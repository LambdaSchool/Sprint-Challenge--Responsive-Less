                        As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most
                        beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that
                        if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

                    Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the
                    qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.

                        The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was
                        absolutely round.

                        It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb
                        blotted out the planet Earth.
