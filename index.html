                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a<br>marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so<br> delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p> Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a <br>globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>
                    <p>which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as<br> equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it. </p>

                    <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.</p>
                    <p>It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea,<br> pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb <br>blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
