  <h2 class="subtitles">Lift Off</h2>

  <p class="subcategory-content">As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine.

    <p class="subcategory-content">It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
