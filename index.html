  <h2>Lift Off</h2>
     
 <P> As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size.
    Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. 
    That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, 
    that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart.
     Seeing this has to change a man.</P>

 <h2> Can We Visit Planets?</h2>

<p> Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as 
 one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in 
 which all the directions eventually meet.which there is no center because every 
 point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.
 The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

    Let's Go For A Walk
  </h2>
    <p>
      The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home
      that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.<br><br>
      It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. 
      I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet 
      Earth.
