      <h2> Lift Off</h2>
      <p>
        As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger
        it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

    <h3>Can We Visit Planets?</h3>

    <p>

      Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet. which there is no center because every point, or
      none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.

    <h3>Let's Go For A Walk</h3>

    <p>

      The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and
      my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.
