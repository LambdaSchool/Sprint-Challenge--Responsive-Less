      <h3>Lift Off</h3>
      <p>
        As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most
        beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched
        it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

        <h3>Can We Visit Planets?</h3> Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a
        single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.
        which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.
        The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

            <h3>Let's Go For A Walk</h3>
            The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was
            absolutely round. It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb
            and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.
