####What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

an adaptive website has set intervals in size that will change the properties of the website elements. A fully responsive website will adapt at any sizes. Generally responsive websites are built using %'s of the full width. 

####Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Mobile first, the design is built with mobile in mind, and the intervals/snap points are added on moving up into a full width website. Desktop first is the opposite. The design is built with desktop first in mind, and the smaller website widths are built in afterwards. 

####What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

Setting font-size to 62.5%, allows 1 rem to equal 10pixels. This gives us a nice baseline standard to calculate give REM values that we know. We can set a font-size of REM: 1.6rem, giving us 16px font, which is the standard font size. 

####How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessing is a process of building CSS code into your website with more structured, dynamic process in mind. CSS can be long and complicated, so to make it easier, we can import different files, nest code, make css style functions, and more. Then when we are ready to build our css, we just preprocesses everything we built and the css is built. 

####What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

    I really like nesting and mixins, make it complex css. However, the structure of nesting can make it seem more complicated. There are times you are within or outside the nesting that cause you to get confused. I think over time I will overcome this obstacle.
