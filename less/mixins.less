// I couldn't find any useful places for more mixins :(
// Hardly any classes had the same two+ properties
// Here's a couple of mixins I didn't need to use very often:

.center-column {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

.flex-between {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
