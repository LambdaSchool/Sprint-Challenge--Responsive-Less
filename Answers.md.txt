    By using fluid grids, a fully responsive website will adapt to the media device no matter the size.

    An adaptive website has several distinct layouts for each media device and depending on the device then that size page is loaded.


   2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    Mobile first means there is a strong focus on a site being optimized on smaller media such as mobile phones and tablets.

    Desktop first is also similar being that the focus is aimed at pc and larger website media sizes.


    3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

    It makes it easy for a developer to calculate rem units.



   4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

    Preprocessing allows the developer to do so much more by adding variables, functions mixins and other things to accomplish more in less time.



   5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

    Nesting is my favorite when using preprocessors. Mixins have been the one thing to give me problems but it won't be that way for long!
