1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    An adaptive website stays static until it hits its break points. What gives it away is a bottom scroll bar while resizing a window.
    A fully responsive website is percent based AND adapts to its break points. Meaning the contents are still visible while resizing a window (no bottom scroll bar).

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    Mobile first - building media queries using min-width
    Desktop first - building media queries using max-width


3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

    It sets the default font-size to 10px, which makes math easier when setting font-sizes in rems later on.


4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

    No more repetitive styling. Preprocessing allows you to build modular and reusable code that the future you or other devs can read easily. By being able to declare variables and create mixins, you can stay organized and write less lines of code, which means easier file navigation.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

    If I had to choose one, my favorite concept is the ability to create mixins. The only concept that I still find difficult is understanding the need for () after a mixin's name.
