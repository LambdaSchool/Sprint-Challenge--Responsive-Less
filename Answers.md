1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Adaptive website fits into different screen sizes, but you have to create different different
layout for each screen size. This becomes a problem because you can't predict the size of the screen.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
When desinging a site for mobile first we use min-width in the media query. Mobile first design takes users who access their 
site through a mobile device and desings the site accordingly. Desktop first uses the max-width in the media query. We then adjust
the styling for mobile devices. 

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
It sets the fon-size to 10px so 1 rem will equal 10px

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
