1.What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

They both change appearance depending on width, however resonsive reacts to all widths while adaptive changes at specific points.

2.Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

You build your css mainly as mobile widths and add media queries for widths like tablets or desktops.

3.What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

Changes the font-size to be able to respond to the user zoom in on screen and adds accesibility.

4.How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessor is like putting coins in a sorting machine. You throw everything in and it does the hard work for you.

5.What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

I like that i can nest divs and classes instead of having to rewrite terms 3 or 4 times to get something specific. What's difficult for me is remembering what is in what folder.
