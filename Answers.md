1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    Responsive sites will change with the screen size, no matter what the size it. Elements will size accordingly. Adaptive sites have specific breakpoints where the layout/size/etc. will change, but there is no responsiveness between those specific breakpoints. 

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    Mobile first means to style the website with the mobile size in mind and then desktop styling would be an afterthought, styled with media queries.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units? 
    It changes the default text size of most browsers to 10px so that you can just divide by 10 to find the rem units.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    Preprocessors have a unique syntax that is converted into CSS. Preprocessors let you use some features like variables and mixins that are not available in regular CSS that allow you to reuse blocks of code throughout your file without repeating the actual code. 
    
5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 
    My favorite concept is mixins. It makes it much easier to keep styling consistent through the page. Nesting gives me the most trouble.
