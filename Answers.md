1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
Adaptive sites only utilize snap points to change when they meet a certain size but 
fully reponsive sites change throughout the size changes. 
For example, there are usually multiple designs or layouts in adaptive but only one steady changing layout with responsive design.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
A mobile frist site is designed with the mobile user in mind. 
These type of sites my for example have their mobile media queries higher in the css than a desktop first site.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
With this adjustment 1REM = 10px.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprosscessing allows that different syntax can be used in coding your CSS. In the case of LESS, it does not mean we are writing less code necessarily
but instead means we are writing it more intuitively by nesting and creating variables to store values or mixins as functions within the styling etc.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
My favorite concept is the mixin as creating mixins reminds me of 
Javascript functions and I see how they can be very useful time savers for styling bigger projects. 
That being said to create effective mixins will take me some practice so they do give me some trouble.
