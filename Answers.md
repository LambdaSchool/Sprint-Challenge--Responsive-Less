1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    - An adaptive website uses fixed withds and non responsive units and has breakpoints using media queries. A fully responsive website uses responsive units combined with media queries for the best experience.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    - Mobile first means that the initial styles not controlled by media queries are for the mobile version of the website then you use min width in your media queries for going up in screen size.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
    - That makes it so that 1rem === 10px so you can do things like say you want a font to be 16px well that makes it easy all you need to do is 1.6rem.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    - I would tell them that it's a way to make css less tedious by having reusable values and chunks of css.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
    - My favorite concept in preprocessing would probably be parametric mixins, when you have a long set of styles for something that needs to be slightly different for different things it is so useful to have parametreic mixins. The only thing that's kinda wierd for me right now is the seperation of all the less files, I'm not used to working that way but I can see how it will be useful on a team. I just need more time a practice to get used to it.
