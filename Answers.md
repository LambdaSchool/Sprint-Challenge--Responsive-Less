1. An adaptive website will change layout using breakpoints to accomodate different devices.
  A fully responsive website uses percentages and other methods so that the current layout doesnt change, but instead matches the screen size.

2. The concept for mobile vs desktop first refers to which device you are initially developing for. Whichever experience is a priority (usually mobile) will be developed first, then the other layouts will be developed as a variation of the prioritized experience.

3. Changing the font-size to a percentage base lets it adapt to the users preferences, setting it to 62.5 allows us to more easily use rem units for font size, because its base-10.

4. Preprocessing is when we use a compiler to write our CSS for us. The compiler will allow us to use shortcuts and other handy tools like variables, to streamline our workflow, then it will read what we've coded and put together a 100% technical CSS document.

5. My favorite concept is nesting, I think it helps me as a learner, to better understand where everything is and flows a lot better with how HTML is coded. The thing I like least is importing different documents. I think it can be kind of cumbersome to switch between pages.
