1. Adaptive websites adapt to the width of the browser at specific break points. Responsive sites respond to the width of the browser at any given point and provide smooth transitions when you are resizing a window. Adaptive sites will not change until you get to a breakpoint, in which you will see elements snap into the adapted size.

2. Mobile first design includes default styles that are meant for mobile devices. Media queries will then include `min-width` sizes. Desktop first design includes default styles for desktop with media queries using `max-width` sizes.

3. `font-size: 62.5%` gives us a default font size of 10px. From there, we can use `rem` units in a uniform and predictable way.

4. Preprocessing allows us to write DRY(don't repeat yourself) code. By introducing variable, mixins, and nesting, preprocessors help us work more efficiently and with less effort. 

5. Nesting elements is my favorite concept in preprocessing. It takes a lot of the brain power away from trying to figure out specificty while I write out my styles.  I don't necessarily have a specific concept that gives me most trouble, it is simply getting into a natural workflow with preprocessors. I have to constantly look at documentation and examples to make sure I'm doing things correctly.
