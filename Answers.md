1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website? Adaptive only cares about the width and the specific points while fully responsive response to any size at any point.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first. Mobile first uses min-width and desktop first uses max width.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units? Helps with older browsers and accessibility. 

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS? It is a  easier way to make changes to a css file by using a compiler. It helps speed up the process and keep the compiled css clean and readable.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? Using the different files to organize the code makes it my favorite. The hardest concept was the parametric mixins, they are hard to understand.
