1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

An adaptive website uses media queries at certain points to make the website to adapt to that screen. A fully responsive website uses media queries and percentages and rems to make the screen adapt at any size and change design when its neccessary for a positive viewer experience.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Min width is used with media queries so the design changes as the screen gets bigger with the mobile first design.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?
It allows for us to simplify calculating what size font we need for example 1 rem at 62.5 % is the equivelant to 10px. 

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessing is using a program to simplify and compartmentalize you code development. The preprocesser takes in a specific language and spits out the code translated.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
My favorite is the ability to seperate components in different files. Organizing code and implementing a clean concept needs more emphasis when i write my code. It seems i spend more time hunting design style code errors than I do acctually developing the website
