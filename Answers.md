What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    Adaptive website detects the screen size of the browser and then load the matching layout fot you, which doesn't change once loaded. A fully responsive website uses media query and can change layout of the website with the no matter what size the browser is.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    Mobile first means the original CSS file is set for mobile viewport, and you use media query to set the layout for desktop (usually 'min-width'); Desktop first is vice versa, it uses max-width.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
    It sets the root font size of the browser to 62.5%, which makes 1 rem equal to 10px;

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    Preprocessing tools allows you to transform more usable & efficient codes into CSS, and eventually makes the coding more maintainable.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
    Fav: the ability to set variables and call it later, so that you can set 'theme' of your website easier.
    The part the troubles me is that, at this moment, I'm not sure when I should write normal CSS and when I should use mixing, therefore I go back to my codes a lot to check repetition and try to avoid it.
