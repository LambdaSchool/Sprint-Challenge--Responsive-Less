1. adaptive web design adapts to different devices. responsive allows for a a design to look good at all screen sizes for many different devices. 

2. when designing mobile first the main content and page is created for a mobile sized screen. it is then responsively updated for larger screen sizes with break points at min-widths. desktop first design is the opposite in that it starts with a main design for a desktop sized screen and then responsively updated for max-width smaller screens.

3. font-size: 62.5% in the html tag sets 1rem to 10px for medium default font size browsers.

4. preprocessing uses a set of tools to make stylying your web design easier and more intuitive and then compiles it to populate your css file. 

5. my favorite concept in preprocessing is mixins and the ability to group often used styling code together.
