What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Adaptive means that there are specific layouts for different types of devices like  a desktop, tablet or mobile version.

Responsive means fluid and responds to the screen size no matter the device.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Mobile first means you are developing your app with the understanding that your users will be most likely view your app on a mobile device before they view it on a desktop. 

Desktop means you develop your app with the sole intention of the user being on a desktop/laptop computer and not on a mobile device.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
it sets the foundation size of the font so that no matter what the user's settings are, it will render the font to fit the screen with out over taking the user's accessibility settings.

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

good question.. I havent figured it out. I would say that its a different way to write and organize your code so that you can make changes on the fly rather than going line by line in your code. 

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?


I like creating module/compenent css rather than having to "create" sections using comments on my css code. It makes changes much easier. I also liked using mixins to help create a better way to use repeatable code. 

I dont like the initial learning curve lol. I didnt have any trouble with anything once I used it.
