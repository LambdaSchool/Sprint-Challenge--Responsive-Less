1. According to Josh Knell, an adaptive website has breakpoints, which are widths of the viewport in which
the webpage will resize to match the viewer's screen as the developer intended. A responsive website uses breakpoints and percentage-based layouts so that the continuous resizing of the screen will result in a website continuously responding to the change in width to look optimal as intended across all varieties of screen size. 

2. A mobile-first design involves using the media queries with a min-width setting and starting the design process with the smallest screens and widening to tablets and then desktops. min-width and mobile-first design is like setting up hurdles that get higher successively to indicate cutoffs. A desktop-first design involves using max-width and starting with desktops first, and dropping the screen size successively until one reaches mobile sizes. It is like setting up limbo bars that get shorter.

3. Font size of 62.5% in the html tag makes the default starting px size of font 10, because the default settings are at 16px, and 62.5% of 16 is 10. This means that when we use rem units (rem = relative to the font size of the root element) the root element is the html tag. Rem units are multipliers of the root element's font size, where for example 2 rem would be 2 x 10px now. So we can easy select fonts by px since it is now in units of 10. For another example, if we wanted 32px, we would use 3.2rem. 

4. Preprocessing is a way to add additional functionality when writing CSS that makes it faster, more understandable, or less tedious for the developer. The preprocessor takes the preprocessor syntax that is written by the developer and compiles that into the actual CSS. It is as if you have an interpreter who can understand the shorthand that you are writing in, and the interpreter rewrites it into longhand for you. 

5. My favorite concept in preprocessing is a tie between variables and nesting. I think it's incredibly thoughtful for someone to have come up with the idea to allow variables in CSS, since it permits making wide-spanning changes to properties that may get frequently changed and are scattered throughout the website's CSS, like color or font size. Nesting is also very handy--it makes it a lot more intuitive to think about CSS and avoid specificity pitfalls. That said I also appreciate mixins. 

The concept I have the most trouble with is probably nested media queries when I have multiple LESS files that get compiled into one index CSS file. I look at the compiled CSS and sometimes wonder whether the queries could get put in the wrong order and affect my website intended design. I suppose import order matters here.
