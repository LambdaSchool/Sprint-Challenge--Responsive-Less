# What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    Adaptive websites have one layout that can shrink to fit many screens.   Responsive websites have different layouts for each type of screen. 

## Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    Mobile first means that the mobile design is created before the desktop design.

### What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?
    Using rem units makes the font size relative to the root element which would be the html tag.  Setting the font size at 62.5% creates a standardized system of measurement where 1rem=10px.

#### How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    It allows you to write css in a shorter format using variables and object-like mixins. That are preprocessed and converted to regular css before they hit the browser.


##### What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 
    My favorite concept is mixins.  I love being able to create a style and apply it to different elements.  Huge time saver.  Not having any trouble.
