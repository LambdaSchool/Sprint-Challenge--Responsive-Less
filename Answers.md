What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    Adaptive websites will change layouts when they hit certain breakpoints such as for tablets, smartphones, or desktops. Fully responsive websites will be change layouts when they hit those breakpoints, but will also change with the size of the screen it is on by using percentages instead of fixed pixels.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    A desktop first website means that the desktop design was created first, then the developers created breakpoints for mobile devices that are smaller . This technique uses max-width in it's media queries. Mobile first does the opposite: the mobile design was created first, then uses min-width breakpoints for devices that are larger.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
    When the html tag is set for 62.5%, this allows us to call on rem units because the root font-size is already set. This number allows for us to not have to make difficult calculations from pixel to rem because it is simply rem * 10. 

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    Preprocessing is a way for developers to write CSS in a more structured format. The preprocessor looks at our meaningful inputs and converts them to CSS for the browser to use.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
    I love the concept of mixins. I found it very time-consuming to write out all the code for things I was using over and over again and mixins are a great way to combat that. The concept that gives me the most issues is probably getting everything situated in the terminal.
