1. Adaptive and Responsive  
  
  Adaptive design revolves around making different layouts for different screen sizes. 

  Responsive design revolves around setting the properties of the layout to respond to different screen sizes via percents. this allows for a layout to be used through several screen sizes.  
  
  The differences between the two include :
    1. Adaptive requires more layouts than Responsive
    2. Adaptive is slightly easier to create than Responsive
    3. Adaptive can't cover every screen size while Responsive can.
    4. Responsie allows for a more pleasant viewing experience.

2. Mobile first, Desktop first

  Mobile first design starts at the mobile view and builds up the the viewport size via the min-width property.

  Desktop first design starts at the desktop view and builds down via the max-width property.

3. Font-size 62.5% do for rem units?

  Setting the html font size to 62.5% sets the rem units to 10px each for every element allowing for easy computation of the size of the fonts. 

4. Descibe preprocessing to someone new to css. 

  Preprocessing is the use of a preprocessor to speed up the css development . It allows for a more visually appealing document that is easier to read and understand due to the nesting ability of preprocessors. Nesting is placing a child element inside the parent element in the css itself. This provides for an easy to understand document. Preprocessors also allow for variables that can make site wide changes much more feasible by storing valuse in those varibles and using the varibles in the css itself. 

5. Like most / gives me the most troube about Preprocessing.

  What I like the most is the nesting ability and easy of reading and understand that preprocessors provide for the css.

  I can't think of anything that gives me much trouble at the moment. The parametic mixins took me a minute to understand but once I got it, it works quite well for me.
