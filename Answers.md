1.  An adaptive website is fluid in the sense that there are different layouts that work well at across the major epochs of the viewport.  For instance, there may be a desktop version of the site in additon to the tablet version and mobile version and each would transition at a certain breakpoint set on the viewport (i.e at a max-width of 500px and below the desktop site will transition to the tablet site).  A responsive site will also do this as well; however the main difference is what is occuring as the viewport is changing size.  In an adaptive site, the transitions to and at the breakpoints are not dynamic and it is more of an abrupt change from each type of layout.  Consider it as literally three seperated layouts that just switch at a given cue; however the fully responsive site is changing dynamically across all sizes of the viewport rendering an ideal site every step of the way, and includes smooth transitions through all of the major breakpoints of the viewport.  Often, this is accomplished with the addition of responsive units, such as rems and percentages, to the media queries that set up the breakpoints used in both adaptive and responsive designs. 

2.  Mobile first is an approach in which you start with the mobile design and then move through the viewport as it grows larger and the rest of the designs follow from that.  A desktop first approach is just the opposite.  In that approach you start with your design on the desktop and design the responsive aspects of the site as the viewport decreases in size, eventually finishing with the mobile design.  

3.  This attribute and the value of 62.5% resets the root font size of the document so that the calculation between rems and px is quick and easy.  With that set as the root font size 10 px becomes equal to 1 rem.  So, a base font size of 1.60rem is now equal to 16px.

4.  Preprocessing CSS adds the power of the programmatic languages to CSS.  It is essentially the CSS one would expect after eating the proverbial +1UP mushroom from the game Mario Bros.  It is essentially JavaScript which is then compiled and minified into vanilla CSS.  With the addition of JavaScript, comes the powers of such things as variables, nested structure, functions, mixins, namespaces and other features not typically present in vanilla CSS.  Essentially, the syntax is mostly the same, with some JS facets thrown in there; however, a compiler is used to transcript all of the code in vanilla CSS.  Also, the ability to use imports is useful and can clean up the file structure very nicely.
