An adaptive website usually makes use of media queries to apply desired styling at specific screen widths, often referred to as breakpoints, whereas fully responsive websites build upon this, by allowing for smooth change through the areas not specifically accounted for by media queries.

Mobile first design is when the base code is written specifically for mobile device sizes, and then scaled up to tablet and desktop sizes via media queries. Desktop first is basically the reverse sequence, starting with Desktop sizing, and working it's way down.

Font-Size (62.5%) manipulates the base font size of most websites, which is 16 pixels. 62.5% of that is 10 pixels, and this allows us to set our rem sizes based on that value (10px), starting.

I would describe Less as a way to write more complex CSS styling, while keeping the structure simple and organized, by borrowing syntax from the JavaScript language, such as variables and functions.

My favorite concept is mixins, particularly because they can be nested, and then kind of become recursive, which is just flat out cool/mind-boggling. What gives me the most trouble is breaking Less into several files, mostly because in my mind, it seems like more work to track seven files of code, than a lot of code in one file, even though I know those seven files contain less code. However, I highly imagine myself coming to enjoy it if I was working on a multi-page site.
