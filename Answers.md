What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    An adaptive website is multiple layouts for various screen ie desktop,tablet, mobile, ect.
    A fully adaptive website is one layout that offers optimal viewing experience no matter
    what type of screen is being viewed on.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    When working on your CSS and using @media to design your layout mobile first which has the smallest 
    pixel layout on top, then goes the tablet layout, and finally the desktop layout which has the largest 
    pixel layout. Desktop first is the opposite where desktop cascades down to mobile's pixel layout.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
    It allows us to convert pixel into rem more easily by using base 10 instead of 16.

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    Preprocessing is an easier syntax to understand. In Lambda we use Less language which is a preprocessor 
    and with the help of a compiler translates the language into normal CSS.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
    Mixins are my favorite, although I haven't used them much because our assignments have been small I appreciate them
    because I know they will come in handy in larger projects and they are fun to build. The radius mixin gives me some
    trouble to understand because I don't see it do much but I think that I will understand it once I start using it more.
