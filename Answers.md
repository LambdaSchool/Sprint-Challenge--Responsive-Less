What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
Fully responsive websites download the whole page, use media queries to detect screen size, then adapt experience based on code for specific screen sizes.
Adaptive websites have templates for each screen size and only download what is needed for each screen.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
mobile-first is programming for a mobile sized screen first. when running media queries min-width is used to scale up. Desktop first is the opposite. It uses max width and scales down

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
16px is the standard font size. 62.5% allows the website to load maintaining what the user has set their font size to. It allows scaling font for accessibility when zoomed.

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
preprocessing allows you to write code in a somewhat simpler way and the compiler then outputs that to the standard CSS.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
I've had some fun with mixins. They can be challenging, but when making the same code over and cover, they streamline the way I write the code. 
preprocessing seems pretty easy compared to standard CSS. I still have to fight alignment but the code looks cleaner and less complicated.
