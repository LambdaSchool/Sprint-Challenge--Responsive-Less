What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
Adaptive will change based on whatever media query break points are available as to where responsive will change in a way that displays optimally regardless of the view port size. Responsive website will include a viewport meta tag, several media queries and percentage width, margin and padding.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
Mobile first means you will be declaring min-width to constrain you containers rather than max-width.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
rem takes it's measurements from the root rather than it's parent. We set the root font-size to 62.5% in the HTML as that is equal to one rem. This will allow the user setting's to change the sizing of the font for accessibility. 

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
A preprocessor is a way to introduce extra features to cascading style sheets similar to a programming language. This includes variables and functon/method style programming as well as being able to nest all of your css in a cascading manner rather than through specificity.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

I enjoy the over all methodology that allows you to build in components similar to react. This keeps the code clean, easy to locate and reusable.
