What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

An adaptive layout uses pre defined screen sizes to change the website. For example the website could be set to change accordingly when it hits a certain brake equivalent to the width of a common phone. A fluid layout allows percentage of width of the layout components. These components adjust to the screen resolution of the user. An adaptive website is more user friendly than a website where all the widths are fixed. However, a fully responsive layout uses a combination of fluid and adaptive layout techniques.


Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

When making a website it is possible to construct it with a desktop first or mobile first design. A desktop first design styles the website with all the widths set up to appear clear and coherent to a desktop user. Then the developer can go about changing the website with fluid and adaptive layout techniques to make it more user friendly for people on small devices. A mobile first layout is when a developer designs the website to be clear and coherent of a mobile device first then goes about changing the website to appear user friendly on a desktop.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

Rem is used to make font sizes based on the root html element. They allow you to quickly scale a website by setting the root element of the website. It is not necessary to change font-size 62.5% in the html tag for using rem. However, in practice it is significantly easier on the developer because it provides easier math conversion. Thats because 62.5% of 16px is 10px. That would make 1.6rem = 16px. Rem allows the users browser font-size to change as they zoom in our out of the webpage or change the default browser font setting.  

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessors extend the user of css by provides variables, operators, interpolations, functions, mixins, and more assets. Processors use css syntax and combine rules and properties similar to a programming language to increase functionality and ease of use.

For example, css is used to define properties and style items on a webpage such as setting a div tag to background-color  red. It is then possible using a preprocessors such as Less to set the color red to a variable then assign it to div tags background-color. 

Like all programming languages pre-processors have different syntax, but each of them understand basic css. Once you have your code written you have it compiled and displayed into a css file that will be used for your website. 


What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

I am a huge fan of mixins. The reason I love mixins is because I can write a block of code and use it over and over again. For example in some of the earlier homework assignments I noticed that I was using the same code again and again to change the website a certain way for mobile design. I took this functionality and put it into a mixin. Then whenever I needed that particular mobile functionality I I would used the mixin. I'm also a huge fan of variables in this regard to. Its also great because if I noticed I want all occurrences of that particular variable or mixin to change a certain way I ony have to change it in one spot to effect the entire website.

I think the concept of nesting probably gives me the most trouble. Not that I get too confused. I think it requires me to constantly look back on where I was on the html and css pages to confirm where I set up my classes. I think with more practice this should become much easier.
