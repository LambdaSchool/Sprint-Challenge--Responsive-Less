1)	What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
-->		Responsive web design :
		servs the same HTML for all devices(Desktop, tablet, mobile) and uses only CSS with media queries to decide 	
		the rendering on each device. 
		-	use percentages(for width, padding, margins) to ensure a websiteâ€™s flexibility, allowing smooth transition from one screen size 
			to the next.
		-	Media queries detect the device being used.
		-	A single template is delivered across all devices.
		-	All on-page elements are downloaded, regardless of device, and then resized to suit.

		Adaptive web design where A set of layouts are designed suited to each screen variation. Layout decisions are then taken at server side, and HTML is served dependent upon device detected.
		-	Client-side code detects device being used.
		-	Separate templates are delivered dependent upon device.
		-	Only the on-page elements required for a particular screen layout are downloaded.
