An adaptive website will have set breakpoints for different devices and resolutions. A responsive website uses both fluid and adaptive techniques to allow the website to change for all resolutions.
If designing mobile first, you are creating your website for a smaller resolution and you will most likely be concentrating on the usability of your contents as opposed to having a lot of content.
