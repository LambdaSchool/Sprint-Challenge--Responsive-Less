1. The difference between Adaptive and Responsive websites is that Responsive websites are fluid, which means that their content is positioned using percents that allows the content to adjust to look good in any screen. Adaptive websites do not do this.

2. Mobile first means that you creating a design for your website for mobile use first, and then working your way up. Desktop first has you starting with designing for desktops, and you work your way down.

3. Setting the font size to 62.5% in the html tag makes it so that each rem unit equals 10 pixels instead of the browser's default (usually 16 pixels). This makes it easier for us to set sizes for fonts using rem since it's a lot easier to do conversions to units of 10 than it is for units of 16.

4. Preprocessing is like a CSS extension that uses its own syntax to provide some cool tools. Some of its tools can help save you time as it allows you to reuse code without having to type it all out again, and it can save you effort as it helps make your code easy to maintain and outputs your code as CSS that's easy to read.

5. Variables are probably my favorite thing about preprocessing, as I don't have to spend as much effort combing through my code to change something that I've used consistently throughout the code. Functions still seem very confusing, but I've only seen it used once so that probably does not help me out very much.
