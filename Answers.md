Comprehension Questions:
1. - Adaptive website: websites that adapts to the width of the viewport of the browser by changing the absolute width of each element of the content based on it original element-to-viewport width ratio.
- Responsive website: Websites that adapts to the change in viewport size by not only changing the absolute width of each content element based on the original element-to-viewport width ratio, but also rearranges the order and layout of the content elements to provide better user experience.

2. Mobile-first coding is a coding style with the main code write-up focusing on the mobile view (e.g. with viewport width of 500px) layout, with added codes to adapt to full desktop view.  Desktop-first coding is a coding style does the opposite.

3. Font-size 62.5% is to normalize the default font size from 16px to 10px (10/16*100=62.5%).  This allows the programmer to adjust the font sizes using the unit 'rem', which respresents multiple of 10px (e.g. 1rem =10px) and a simpler yet responsive unit to work with.

4. - Preprocessing is programming in a syntax that is more concise and logical to the programmer, which the syntax then be compiled (i.e."pre-processed") into normal CSS syntax, before the full website is rendored.
- My favorite concept of preprocessing is nesting.  It is very logical and you can see the specificity order much clearer than normal CSS.  
- The parametric mixin is a simple concept to understand, but a slightly challenging concept to adopt in actual coding.  It makes the passing of information more logical and the editing of codes much faster, but following the flow of the information being relayed requires careful tracing.
