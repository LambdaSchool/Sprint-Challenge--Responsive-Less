Question 1: With an adaptive website, the two noticeable differences are 1) all information is pre-selected to where only device-specific information would be displayed and 2) several templates are generated and optimized for each possible viewing device.

Question 2: Mobile first is the industry practice of building a website and its contents with mobile device users first in mind. Thus, making sure all content is mobile-freindly and scalable to desktop second.

Question 3: Font-size: 62.5% standardizes all font sizes to relative medium size (i.e. 16px). This brings the conversion of pixels to rems to a 10:1 ration. For every 10 pixels, you roughly product 1 rem. 16px =  1.6rem.

Question 4: Preprocessing introduces more intuitive tools such as variables, scoping, mixins, and functions to create an easier to use format in CSS for styling across multiple devices.

Question 5: I would personally say my favorite part in preprocessing would be the nesting feature. It tidy ups code significantly as long as you go in with you organization in mind. The concept that gives me the most trouble so far is just the cross-referencing. You have to cross-reference so many files that you can get lost in the process if you are not careful.
