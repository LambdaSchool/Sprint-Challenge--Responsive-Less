Answer the following questions to the best of your ability. You can exercise your Googling skills and use training kit.  Open up the [Answers.md](Answers.md) file and record your responses there.

1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
`An adaptive website is a website that requires a design pretty much for every size of device, where as a fully responsive website generally works on all devices with minor modifications in the main design.`

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
`Mobile first design is with mobile layout in mind with a possibility to extend to desktop, where as desktop first is designed for desktops in mind. 
In a mobile first design the main css is for mobile and then the developer extends it using min-width to tablets and further to desktops. In a desktop design the main css is meant for desktops.`

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units? 
Helps set 1rem = 10px.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
* `Preprocessing helps designers develop complex CSS in a simple resuable way. One simple example would be center aligning text in a div, which if used in multiple places creates a lot of CSS and also very difficult to track and change. With pre-processing you can use variables and set them with the required center alignment settings then reuse it across the design file to maintain easier CSS code.`

* `Preprocessing as the name suggests can be put as => before it is processed to CSS. Once you have written your preprocessor, it uses Javascript to compile and convert it into CSS. There are various pre-processors including less, sass etc, that work on the same principle but have different ways of defining variables, mixins etc.`

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
`I love mixins and refactoring with CSS, I have yet to learn more in-depth usage of pre-processing with less but it gave me an insight as to why HTML/CSS has now become a developer driven thing verses what it was in the past.`
