Question 1: 

Adaptive designs include breakpoints for different screen sizes and rearrange the content based on the given screen size, but are static between breakpoints.  Fully responsive designs use percent-based widths to make the content responsive at all screen sizes, but still include breakpoints.

Question 2:

Mobile first means that the designer first develops the mobile design, so breakpoints include a min-width; desktop first means that the desktop design is developed first, so breakpoints include a max-width.

Question 3: 

Setting the font-size to 62.5% gives you a 1 rem = 10px conversion without messing up the user's browser settings -- if they adjusted the default text size, for example.

Question 4:

Preprocessing is the use of a "helper" language that is easier to read or organize and includes time-saving efficiencies.  The helper language is compiled into regular CSS.

Question 5: 

My favorite concept is nesting elements to mimic the html structure.  I think that makes it sooo much easier to read at a glance. I'm still coming around to mixins, but I am starting to see how using them can leave my code much cleaner-looking in the end.
