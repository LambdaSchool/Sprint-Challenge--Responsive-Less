responsive design will scale with the browser no matter what size and therefor is more fluid. Whereas, adaptive design will "snap" to different sizes based on the width coded into design. As a result, adaptive will have 2 or more "snap" points like full screen (1000px), tablet view (800px), and phone view (500px). When the viewing device is at those widths the adaptive will "snap" to that new design at those break points.
When doing a mobile design the website will be designed as if viewing from a mobile device such as a phone first then using media queries and/or responsive/adaptive design the webpage/app will grow in size using min-width as a value in the CSS. On the other hand, desktop first takes the opposite approach and designs the webpage/app from a max view perspective and then the webpage/app will scale down in size with the max width code in CSS.
the font size 62.5 % in the html tag is awesome as it basically lets us easily use rem. The px to rem ratios in decimal format are utilized by simply moving the decimal one place. Example 10.0px = 1.0rem and 32px would be 3. and so on.
preprocessing in a nutshell allows us to write our "code" in a different format then the preprocessor boils that "code" down to the original language. For example, by using LESS we can nest the "code" in a way that mimics our HTML and we can also use "functions" (and what not) to make our script easier to read/write. The less compiler then rewrites the "code" into CSS for us.
My favorite concept in preprocessing is the ability to nest like HTML so I can easily determine where I am at and see the parent/child relationship with relative ease. The thing that gives me the most trouble is... why we don't import the reset.less before anything else like variables and mixins. In my mind the reset should come first, so that it doesn't "reset" the mixins and variables. Then again I think LESS is lazy and also Josh imported the reset in his project before the mixins and variables he just did not have us do it on our projects.
