1. an adaptive web site doesn't use responsive units in there layout. Changes layout by creating each layout with hard coded pixels

2. Mobile first is when you start with a mobile layout and use @media(min-width: ...px) to change from layout to layout. Desktop is starting from a Desktop layout and using @media(max-width: ...px) to change instead.    

3. This REM size is based on the base size of the html tag, what font-size: 62.5% does is allow for an easy way to convert a value in pixels to REM. 1 rem equals 10 pixels.

4. a program that lets you write ccs in a more efficient  fashion, while also  changing the original css for you.

5. It was a bit overwhelming at first, but I love all preprocessing concepts equally now.
