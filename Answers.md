1. An adaptive website is a site that is based on media queries, but its layout is not percentaged based while a responsive website is both.

2. Mobile first starts developement from the viewport of a mobile device useing the min-width media query and expands to desktop and the desktop first uses the max-width media query and ends in the mobile viewport.

3. It turns the 1rem to equate to 10px instead of the default 16px without the rule.

4. Preprocessing is a tool for better css orginization and maintainance. It makes it easier to change values on the fly due and reuse code due to its variables and mixins.

5. My favorite concept is the nesting. You do not need to hunt down code anymore especially when working on different viewports. The concept that gives me the most trouble is choosing what to use in a parametric mixin. I understand what is needed. It just takes time for me to find what to use.
