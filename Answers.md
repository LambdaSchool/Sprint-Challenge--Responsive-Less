#Answer One:
> An adaptive website is one that supports multiple viewports, but is still fixed widths. A fully responsive site is a site that does more than adapt, it fluidly adjusts to the viewport size, usually/typically after setting a max-width and width of 100 percent.
#Answer Two:
> With a mobile first approach, one starts from a small viewport using a min-width rather than max-width, and works their way from the ground up, rather than top down approach used with max-with for desktop first. Mobile users are a large percentage of today's website users, and learning this approach (mobile first) is beneficial to the future of the web.
#Answer Three:
> A `font-size: 62.5%;` applied to the html element of a CSS or LESS document, enables a sort of size "_hack_" where `rem` sizing can easily be set using a faux pixel representation. Example: `font-size: 0.1rem;` is equivalent to 1 pixel, and `font-size: 1.0rem` is there for equal to setting the size to ten pixels, in child elements of the root element.
#Answer Four:
>Well, I actually went over this last night with my daughter and some friends. To summarize: Pre-processing is akin to taking an apple, washing it, peeling it, and slicing it, before biting into any of the apple. To elaborate: You take your chosen preprocessor, and write the appropriate syntax and then you run it through the wringer, converting and slicing it out into its appropriate parts. In short, it is a system to annotate your code and streamline it, cutting down production time, and allowing you to write _*maybe*_ less code, or at least, more effective code.
#Answer Five:
>To be vague, all of them. To be specific... probably my favorite are parametric mixins. Although they were the most troubling (as well as favorite) at first, simply because I could not find use for them, they have been growing familiar to me. I think my second favorite would have to be variables however. I love the fluidity of being able to change multiple lines of code just by switching a variable's declarative.
