1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
A responsive website will resize with every pixel width change, whereas an adaptive website has
fixed designs for each specific screen size and won't change until that pixel ratio is reached. 

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
A mobile first design is designed specifically for mobile screens. You would use "min-width:" 
in your @media. 

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units? 
It makes it so that 1rem is 10px. This isn't a rule to follow, it just makes using rem easier.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing takes your Less syntax and translates it into CSS. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 
My favorite concept is nesting. To me, it makes everything feel more organized. The concept I would say I have the least grip on are probably mixins. Not because I don't know how to use them, it's more just getting used to the new tools at my disposal.
