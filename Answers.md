1.Responsive design is where the webpage is changed to fit the viewport so it will shrink or grow. Adaptaive design is that a new layout is made for the different screen sizes.
2.Mobile-first is when the mobile layout is made first and then media queries are used to make the desktop version. Desktop-first is the opposite, the desktop layout is made first and then media queries are made to make the mobile version.
3.The font-size being 62.5% will take the default size of 16px and will make 1rem equal to 10px. Therefore it makes it easier to do the math when using rems.
4.Preprocessing is a form of CSS that is used to help make CSS code easier and quicker to read. It has different functions like nesting that lets us see specifcity in CSS and lets us nest media queries so we do not have to scroll to the bottom of the page like normal CSS. There are also mixins that are used so we do not have to repeat the same multi-line code in multiple areas, instead we only use one line of code.
5.My favorite concept in preprocessing is the nesting. I do not like having to repeat the same code to make sure the specifcity is right and I like that I can have media quieres next to what I am changing instead of scrolling to the bottom of the page. The concept that gives me some trouble is the mixins. I sometimes forget to add semicolons at the end, which give me errors. However, I do like the parametric mixins because it makes some areas of my code easier to control.
