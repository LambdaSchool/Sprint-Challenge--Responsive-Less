2Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

well it means you would design either the mobile experience and expand, or design the desktop and shrink down

3What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

it sets the 1rem to a base font size of 10 to make calculations easier, personally like the border-box stuff it's easy enough to leave out.

4How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

it's like a compiler for your programming language, a shortcut way of doing things, i guess is what I would say.  Compileception!

5What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

I enjoy nesting my classes and elements, variable and mixins seem cool, but I do NOT enjoy nesting my media queries, I'd rather do that css vanilla way
