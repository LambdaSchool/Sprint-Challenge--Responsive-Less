What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Responsive websites always change depending on the device whereas adaptive detects the screen size and provides the layout specified for that size.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Mobile first means building the website with mobile consumers in mind first and then doing styling for desktop. Desktop first is the reverse.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

It allows for the simple conversion of px to rem by moving the decimal point one unit to the left.


How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Rather than writing out every specificity in a CSS file, preprocessing allows code to be written once and compiled into a CSS file where the preprocesser writes out the chains of specificity for you.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

My favorite concept is the ability to use mixins and variables so that code only needs to be written once and then called as many times as necessary. 

I don't enjoy the fact that the preprocesser always has to be up and running when you're  developing because I find that it slows my computer down.
