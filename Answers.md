An adaptive website is less flexible than a fully responsive website in that a responsive website responds to the size of the browser at any given point, no matter the width. An adaptive website responds to the width of the website at specific breakpoints.

Mobile first means creating a website with first mobile devices in mind then working you way backwards towards larger devices such as tablets then desktops at the end. Desktop first means that the webpage is being developed for desktops first then making it responsive to smaller devices down the road.

Having font-size 62.5% basically makes it easier for us to use rem units in that they are 1:1 in terms of using. So 1rem would be 10px, making it a base 10.

Preprocessing let's the developer organizethe code and recycle code. It lets the developer use variables and mixins that can be reused all while following the more organized structure of nesting and overall adds more functionality.

My favorite concept in preprocessing has to be the ability to nest your code and netly orgainze it. The concept that gives me trouble would have to be variables, more specific being that at what point is too many variables too much.
