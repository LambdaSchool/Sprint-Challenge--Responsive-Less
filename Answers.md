1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    A responsive website displays stuff based on the available browser space. That means the elements in the design file will adjust to changing browser widths. Responsive loads faster since it only needs to load what fits on the detected screen size. Adaptive websites change layout to only a few pre-selected widths. They load slower since every adaptive layout size must load regardless of screen size. Also, adaptive websites need to be updated more often since new device sizes come out that make the layout not look as good.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
   Mobile first is designed with mobile view in mind first so it is paired down, and becomes beefed up as screen size increases. Desktop first is designed with the large screen in mind and as screen width shrinks, the layout contents are pared down.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?
   It sets the base unit of font size to 10px and thereby makes the mental math a lot easier for sizing with rem units.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
   Preprocessing allows you to streamline your css and be more creative with your css all while making it more readable to others.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
   Favorite: It tells me exactly where I am messing up in css.
   Trouble: I apparently did not properly follow install or set up and lost an hour on the sprint because the js script compiler was running insted of lessc. Even though everything went smoothly less than 24 hours before on the pre-processing homework. Oh, well. Most difficult overall for me is nesting, followed by looking at multiple little less files after getting used to seeing everything spread out on one sheet.
