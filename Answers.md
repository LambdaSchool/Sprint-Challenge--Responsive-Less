1) Adapative allows for set screen size setup, does not change in between, looks good only at those sizes. Responsive changes in between to make the site look good at all sizes. 

2) Mobile First means the page is set up first as a mobile view, typically 500px wide or under, and has break points set to change when the screen is expanded. Desktop first is opposite, instead setup to show largest screen size first, then has breakpoints for smaller screen sizes. 

3) makes the text size much smaller when the 62.5 is set, but allows for responsive font-size setting, using rem instead of px. 

4) the closest youll get to actual coding, in html/css? lol 
I would say to them that it is extremely powerful and useful for large projects, and a must have skill. Also that in the case of "LESS" it allows you to write 'less' css haha

5) Favorite is nesting. Mixins are strange to me, but I'm getting it.
