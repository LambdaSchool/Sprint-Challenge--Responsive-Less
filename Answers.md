#### What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

With an adaptive website there are several different layouts targeted towards different devices such as a mobile layout or a tablet layout and then a desktop layout. With a fully responsive website you'll see a layout that adjusts to work best for the device it's displaying on. One way to see a responsive website in action is to adjust the web browser window on a computer making it smaller or larger, if the website adjusts with the size of the browser window the website is responsive.


####Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Mobile first means your focus is to build the core of the website first (those features that are high on the list of a mobile users needs) and progressively work your way up to a desktop version per the specifications. Desktop first means you work on the most complete design overall with every feature and function that's laid out in the design specification and then work your way down to mobile design and/or smaller resolutions.
