Task 2: Comprehension Questions

1.  In an adaptive website, the server detects the type of device and then loads the information it wants to the device.
A responsive website differs in that it would rely on the device to detect the media queries set up by the developers of the website to set up how the website looks.

2.  Mobile first would be the developer utilizing the concept of min-width when creating the website versus the developer utilizing the concept of max-width in desktop first.

3.  Using font-size: 62.5% in the html tag makes the entire content of the page respond to 1 rem as 10px, which makes it a lot easier to use rem to make a responsive website.

4.  If I were to explain preprocessing to someone new to CSS, I would say that it is a means of using an extended set of syntax to create CSS code in a way that is more efficient.

5.  My favorite concept in preprocessing is the ability to nest. The concept that gives me the most trouble is operations using percentages.
