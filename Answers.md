1) Responsive website is best to use from mobile to desktop viewing, however, it is harder to make. Adaptive websites have several layouts to accomadate different screen sizes.

2) Desktop first is built for the highest specifications, designed for the support of more complex features. Mobile first is mainly for its functional abilties and convenience to the user.

3)62.5% fontsize means 1 rem is equal to the font size of the html element and for most browsers that is 16px.

4) A preprocessor takes one type of data and converts it to another type. This is good for something complex like css that requires a lot of the same actions. Preprocessors makes this process more efficient.

5) I like the nesting, it matches up with the html so I dont get lost. The mixins are still a little confusing.
