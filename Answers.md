**1.** Pre-processors extend CSS with variables, operators, interpolations, functions, mixins and many more other usable assets.

**2.** ```$ npm install -g less```

**3.** ```@tablet: ~"(max-width: 768px)";```

**4.** Fixed layout is unresponsive and does not change with user action.

Adaptive layout uses media queries to alter the site at certain breakpoints.

Fluid layout uses adaptive layout but also continues to resize the elements of the site in between those breakpoints.

**5.** We need to use the CSS property max-width in a responsive website because since we are determining widths with percentages, the element would continue to grow for as long as the window increases in size.
