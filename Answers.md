1. Adaptive uses breakpoints and a fully responsive website uses breakpoints and percentages.

2. mobile first mens the initial design starts with the mobile view and uses breakpoints with min-width up throu desktop. When building desktop first you hstart with the desk top version and then use max-width and build your break points down.

3. Most browsers have a default font sie of 16px the 62.5% converts that to 10px so that when using rem the math is easy. 1.6rem is 16 px. 

4. Preprocessing is the most amazing thing on the planet because... you can actually mirror your css to your html. Which makes it so much easier to write and you don't have to search for all your possible mistakes. It also if written correctly, keeps you from overwritting styles. Anyways, then it takes all these things and consumes them and gives you the pretty css that you probably would jhave taken 10 times longer to write yourself. 

5. Favorite concept in preprocessing is well all of it. I love the fact that the sections are broken up and then imported in. I ahve never had such an easy time with css. So far I get it all.
