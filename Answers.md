1. Responsive web design uses a grid system which will make the design respond to any screen size. Adaptive web design has many different layouts assigned to specific screen sizes.

2. First you must consider who your audience/viewers will be and then figure out if most of your viewers will be using a desktop or mobile device. If your viewers will most likely be looking at your website on a mobile device then your webpage will be centered around the "mobile first" approach to design.

3. Setting the HTML font-size to 62.5% will then set the default font-sizes to 10px which is also converted into 1rem. (20px=2rem, 30px=3rem, etc.)

4. Preprocessing is essential for organizing CSS code. It separates reusable code and variables into other files for readability. Preprocessing increases productivity and decreases the amount of code you are writing.

5. My favorite concept in preprocessing is setting your own variables. The concept that i have the most trouble with is using mixins.
