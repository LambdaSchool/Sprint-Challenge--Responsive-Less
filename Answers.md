adaptive websites check for the device and then present a screen made for that device. Fully responsive websites change as the screen size is changed. They dont have seperate designs, use a fluid type grid to achieve this. 
mobile first means you design the initial site for a mobile device. your code checks for min values. desktop first checks for max values and you design the site first for a desktop size screen. Then rearrange or remove items as the screen size shrinks. 
it allows us to use the rem units by changing the decimal point. for example, font size of 12px becomes 1.2rem. 
It is a layer, the first layer of css. It's like a box of tools that you can use to simplify or enhance your css. The preprocessor takes this code and converts it to pure css code. compiling it first makes it much easier for the end user to view web pages quickly.
Favorite concept is the mixin. It also gave me the most trouble to begin with. It allows me to group code the same way i divide it up in my mind. It sounds kind of odd but i visualize code differently than most people. Maybe i am old school but i have been doing code for over 25 years. The mixins actually got me excited about css.
