What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
-An responisive website adpapts to the screens width much like water can fill the container it's in. It relies more on percentages and changing the size of the window, you can see the changes happen fluidly. An adaptive website uses breakpoints more than percentages. Changing the browser window, the content will stay the same size until a certain width, and then it will snap to a smaller (or larger) size.
Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
-Mobile first web design prioritizes mobile users while desktop first prioritizes desktop and laptop sizes first. A mobile first website can use breakpoints of min-width, while desktop sites use breakpoints of max-width.
What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
-rem font sizes are relative to the html content. If you put font-size: 62.5% in the html tag, it scales all rem font sizes to 10 pixels (i.e. 1 rem=10 pixels). This is to make calculations easier, as if font-size were 100%, 1rem would equal 16pixels.
How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
-Preprocessing is supposed to make writing CSS easier, preprocessors take the code you write and compiles it into CSS. You can use varibles and nesting in preprocessors along with mixins and functions.
What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
-My favorite conceept of preprocessing is the nesting techniques. It makes styling a lot easier. The part that gives me the most trouble is creating mixins because I don't put them in until I finish coding the entire page and see where I have repeats in my styling.
