What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
  adaptive websites will have a set number of pages to be viewed at different sizes on a page for different media. With responsive there 
  page is set up so it will changes views depending on the type of device being used?


Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first?
  mobile first is being tailored to mobile users by making things easier to navigate, read and use. With desktop it's a bit easier 
  and websites have always been made for desktop viewing in mind.
  

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
  it's the em values from h1, p1, li content and the body added togther. Now we have a set size for the base elements.
  

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
  it makes writing css more efficient where as you don't have to repeat yourself(DRY) when writing code. It also opens new avenues 
  where having individual files that all are connected to one file can be updated.
  

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
  My favorite is nesting with properties but adding media queries inside the same block.
