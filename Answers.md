1.What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
A- An adaptive website is a website that has different distinct designs for each type of screen size. A responsive website is one that tends to stick to one layout but is fluid in responding to shrinking. So no matter how much you resize the screen the same layout will respond to that size.

2.Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
A- To be mobile first means the primary adaptive styling layout you use is going to be for mobile devices. Vice versa with desktop first. Whatever comes second is the next style/device.

3.What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
A- The very specific font-size: 62.5% sets up the entire web page's adaptability for using rem units to an easier 1.0 scale. Meaning that if you want size 14 font then its easier to write 1.4rem instead of some random rem size thats not proportional.

4.How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
A- Preprocessing essentially takes an already tedious process and ... easy-fies the whole system to make the user use less code, smarter labeling, and structured styles. Now, you have to be well informed on preprocessors though as they could do more harm than good if you are unaware of how to use them.  

5.What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
A- My current favorite concept in preprocessing has to be two things, layering css elements instead of using long grandchildren descriptors, and using variables for keeping the style congruent on multiple elements in an ordered way. The one concept that is currently giving me the most trouble for some reason is mixins. It may just be that I need to research on them more or practice more with them as they are very powerful to style entire elements with one word/one line of preset styling that can be used over and over.
