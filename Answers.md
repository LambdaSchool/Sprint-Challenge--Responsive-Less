1. If you had to teach someone with basic CSS knowledge what a preprocessor was, how would you describe it?

There are a few examples of preprocessors, such as LESS and SASS. A preprocessor helps with the design of a website. It is an updated version of the antiquated CSS and has several benefits, including the ability of nesting to make the hierarchical structure of a site more apparent. You write the code in the pre-processor and then it translates it to CSS. The act of writing the code is a bit easier, but the website still gets the CSS it needs for styling.

2. What is the command in node package manager (npm) to install LESS globally on your computer?

npm install -g less

3. Please provide an example of a mixin you have used in a project this week. 

A few of the mixins I experimented this week were the tinted-color and shaded-color.


4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, and fluid layout? 

Fixed Layout does not reconfigure for the type of device it is on.

An Adaptive Layout reconfigures at certain benchmarks. For instance, three different sizes would be made for the general size of a phone, a tablet and a laptop.

Fluid is constantly adapting. If you change the size of your browser window by 20 pixels, the layout will adapt in a manner the designer desired.

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width in a responsive website?

Max-width acts as a benchmark for when a layout should reconfigure. For instance, we put max-width: 400px for phone and anything 400 and under acts as a phone; same for 768 for tablet-size and 1100 for laptop size.
