1. Unlike adaptive websites, responsive websites only have one master layout which can change to the user's delight. With multiple layouts it is difficult to create an adaptive web page.
2. Mobile first is the idea that a webpage should be designed and built with the initial intention of it being used on a smartphone. Since the increase in usage of smartphones for everyday life the need for desktops have decreased exponentially, especially since phones can be used anywhere.
3. 62.5% is the percent equivalent of 16px, which is the standard webpage font. With this percentage web page developers can calculate elements in terms of rem instead of pixels, which is believed to be an improvement.
4. A preprocessor, if I was to explain it to someone new to programming, is a program or equation which when you put something in it gives you an answer or variable which can be used for another question or equation. 
5. I really like mixins, simply because I enjoy the idea of DRY coding. Especially when there are certain elements where repeating yourself just can't be helped mixins can save so much time and energy. Hilariously however I have a problem with nesting it seems. For some reason its difficult for me, currently, to find where everything goes and fits together.
