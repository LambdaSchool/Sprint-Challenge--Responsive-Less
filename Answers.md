1. An adaptive website changes its layout based on screen size, while responsive web design scales the page to the screen size instead of changing the entire layout.

2. Mobile first or Desktop first describes the design style where you style a webpage first for consumption by either mobile or desktop browsers, and then code in other size views afterward.

3. font-size: 62.5% will adjust the pixel conversion of rems to equal 10px, making website sizing with rems much easier.

4. Preprocessing is writing CSS in a more human-friendly manner, with powerful tools. The pre-processor converts the code (LESS, SCSS, etc) into raw CSS.

5. My favorite preprocessing concept is mixins, which also give me the most trouble in effectively deploying them.
