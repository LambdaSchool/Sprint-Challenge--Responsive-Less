1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Adaptive websites have different layouts that load at different screen sizes. Responsive design responds to the width of the screen using % for all the width sizes to adjust fluidly when the screen gets smaller or bigger.


2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Desktop first means to design the website for a desktop display first then make media breaks for smaller screen sizes. Mobile first is to design the website for mobile screens first then add media break points for bigger screens.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units? 

It makes it so 1rem is equal to 10px.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessors allow you to create reusable variables that take the place of font sizes, colors etc and allows you to change them all at once by changing the variable instead of having to go line by line changing each occurrence. It also allows you to write css using nesting which closer mimics the actual html being written. They also have mixins which allow multiple variables if you wanted each section to have the same font size, color and style etc.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 

My favorite concept is nesting. The concept giving me the most trouble is knowing when to use mixins and variables and proper syntax.
