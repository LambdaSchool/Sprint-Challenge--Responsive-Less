1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
An adaptive website will scale to different sizes, but may not always be readable or look good in tablet/phone screens. A fully responsive website will change according to set media breakpoints, which will allow the site to look good in other screen sizes.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
A mobile first site is designed for a mobile view, and then expanded using media breakpoints to look good in tablet and desktop views. It's like working in reverse from the desktop first view, which is designed for a desktop first and then scaled down from there to look good on tablet/phone browsers.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units? 
Setting the font size to 62.5% will make rem units easier to work with. Since 10 is 62.5 percent of 16 (which is the standard px font size), it allows us to use rem units that make sense, without fidgetting with numbers. 1.6 rem = 16px.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing is like code for css, complete with compilers, functions and variables that let you have greater control over your css code. This makes it easier to change the settings that you may wish to adjust - like color schemes, if setup with variables.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 
Variables and mixins are my favorites.  I come from a coding (C/PHP) background, so these are very familiar to me. The only thing giving me trouble is that I keep trying to use $ instead of @ symbols!
