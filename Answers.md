1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

- Responsive Web Design provides the optimal viewing experience of a website, no matter what type of device the user is seeing it on,
- Adaptive web design is different from responsive design in that there isn’t one layout that always changes. Instead, there are several distinct layouts for multiple screen sizes. And the layout used depends on the screen size used

- When a website features a responsive design, it means it will adapt to the width of users’ screens, allowing for maximum versatility. When a website is adaptive, it will adapt to specific screen widths of desktop computers, tablets or smartphones. Devices all have set browser widths that are widely known and enable developers to develop websites that will adhere to their specifications.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

- Mobile first design a website for the smallest mobile devices possible and then scale upwards to adapt to desktop computers.
- Desktop first design is often based on the assumption that visitors will browse it on a desktop computer. Then, the website is modified to adapt to different devices, including smartphones and tablets.
