1. **What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?**
  * Adapative design is design made for diiferent screen sizes (breakpoints) where resposnsive design is made for all varying screen sizes.

2. **Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first?**
  * Designing first for mobile before designing for other screen sizes.
3. **What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?**
  * Makes converting px to rem units esaier because it sets a rem unit at 10px so 16px whould be 1.6 rem
4.  **How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?**
  * It makes CSS more powerful and easier to manage by introducing variables so that you can change the style of certain elements all at once and uses things like mixins so that you don't have to repeat certain lines of code over and over again.
5. **What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?**
  * My favorite concept in preprocessing is variables.  The concept that gives me the most trouble is overall recognzing when to use varables, mixins and parametrics effectively.
