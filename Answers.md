1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

While both adaptive and fully-responsive designs customize the website for optimal performance based on the screen size of the device, adaptive websites remain the same until the screen size reaches a specific breakpoint, and then it snaps into place in a new design that's optimal for that screen size.

A fully-responsive website will generally have percentage based widths and will adjust fluidly for every change in screen size.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

A mobile-first website will be designed for a user-base that is expected to primarily access the website via their mobile device. This means that it will be primarily designed for a smaller size screen, using min-width breakpoints and developing the desktop or tablet version second.

A desktop-first website will be designed for use primarily from a large screen and will be designed with that in mind, using max-widths for breakpoints and designing the mobile or tablet version second.


3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

The font-size: 62.5% sets the default font size to 10px (because the original default is 16px) which makes design easier since it's in units of 10. A rem is a multiple of this font size, so 1 rem now equals 10px.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

A preprocessor is a program that allows a developer to input information intended for a specific language in a much shorter and more intuitive way, and then compiles this information and organizes it in a way that's readable for the intended language. Using a preprocessor makes writing code more “human-friendly.”

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

My favorite concept in preprocessing is nesting. It makes things much more organized and easier to access, especially when it comes to writing media queries. The most difficult preprocessing concept for me so far is parametric mixins.  I generally understand the idea, but when they're being passed through multiple variables and get several layers deep, I get confused.
