What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Answer: In Adaptive websites, templates, layouts (and information) are pre-selected for different screen sizes. 
        Things are planned out in advanced and information is displayed based on specific devices (i.e., phone vs tablet). However, for Responsive websites, devices are detected with media queries and images are sized 
        correctly depending on the user's screen size. 
        
        In Responsive, there is only one template, unlike adaptive sites, which has many templates for many screen.
