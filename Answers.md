1.) adaptive uses multiple html layouts for different devices and responsive uses a single html layout with media queries to make appropriate changes per device.

2.) Mobile first is when you design the initial css for the mobile view. Then the other views tablet and desktop are created in this order with media queries using a min-width condition, while desktop first is completely opposite. Design for desktop first then media queries for tablet and mobile in this order with a max-width condition.

3.) font-size: 62.5% in the html tag initializes all font sizes with in the html to be set to 10px because default is 16px. Given rem units are a multiplier of the base font size this provides a simple method for setting font-size of other elements. 

4.) Preprocessing is a way to simplify and organize your css styles making styling easier for the creator and others that may use them in the future. 

5.) My favorite are variables and nesting. The hardest are functions.
