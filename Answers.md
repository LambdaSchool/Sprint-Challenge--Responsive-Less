1) Adaptive relies on predefined screen sizes to adapt itself; whereas, responsive changes to fit any given screen size. Responsive does this by using media queries. Adaptive layouts use different templates for different device. 
2) Mobile first uses min-width and the css is built from small to large. Desktop uses media queries based on max-width, and it is built from large to small screen sizes.
3) It sets the default font-size to 10px, allowing rems to be calculated much easier. It also allows browsers to change the default font-size and the rem fonts will expand at the same rate.
4) Preprocessing is a more robust syntax for CSS written in a different language. It helps code stay DRY.
5) My favorite concept is the ability to nest selectors. Mixins give me the most trouble.
