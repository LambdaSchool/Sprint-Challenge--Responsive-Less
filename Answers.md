1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
I would describe adaptive website as more archaic and rigid. A responsive website is adaptive and fluid and it has you covered for desktop or mobile. 

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
Mobile first means that you build your mobile site first and adapt it to desktop second. Desktop means you design it for desktop and then you adapt it to mobile by using max and min widths. 

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?
This makes it easier to conver rem. 1rem= 10 font size when we do this. So 2rem is equal to 20px. 

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
I would describe Preprocessing as an essential part of your development career. It helps us organize and write readable code. It makes it mych easier to read and can help other developers. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
My favorite is mixins. I like being able to set variables as well. 
I still have problems making the code pretty and readable.
