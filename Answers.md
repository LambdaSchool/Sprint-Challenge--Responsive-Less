1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    Adaptive sites are created to look good on pre-selected device and screen sizes. On the other hand Responsive design uses media queries and flexible grid layouts to allow the site to gracefully flow from one screen size to another without "breaking" or hiding important content along the way. 

    Also, adaptive sites select which HTML to display depending on the device but fully repsonsive sites us the same HTML and desplay it on each device differently thanks to the media queries.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    Mobile first means that the primary design is in mobile. This means that in a fully responsive site media queries will be using a min-with and the site will be built starting at the smallest view and moving up. Desktop first uses max-width media queries and starts from the largest view and works it's way to the smalles. 

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units? 

    This is a great trick that allows all of our future rem values to go off of a ratio of 1rem = 10px (at default or standard screen size view). This makes it much easier to convert px and to use a more standard measurement. 

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

    Preprocessing uses a programming language that is not CSS to create an compile CSS in a more orgaized and all around powerful way. Allowing for a more flexible CSS which can be edited on a large scale a lot faster. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 

    I really enjoy the mixins and variables that are really powerful and a very fun thing to find different uses for. The thing that gave me just a little trouble was the escaping but overall preprocessing came very naturally after knowing CSS.
