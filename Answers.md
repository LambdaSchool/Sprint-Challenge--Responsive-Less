Adaptive is used for a fixed viewport on a website. Using units of measure like px. Fully responsive websites are sites that the viewport conforms depending on the divice. It allows users to fully see all of the websites contents confortablly. 
Mobile firs design mmeans the cascading style order begins with mobile styles, after the main content.
It helps so that the font size stretches as the viewport changes. Instead of a fixed size using px. 
I would describe it as a data converter. it takes one of data like less and utilize it in another like CSS.
I can't honestly say i have a favorite, I have had my share of trouble with mixins (perimetric)
