1. Adaptive design simply change font-size, margin, padding, etc with different screen sizes. Fully responsive designs incorporate complete structure changes using media queries, and different break points.

2. Mobile first begins structuring with the mobile devices in mind, typically stacking photos and nav component for a seamless scrolling experience. Desktop first, however, sets structure of the website with the desktop sized devices in mind. The nav components, as well as photos and content are often more spread out to take advantage of the larger screen.

3. Using font-size: 62.5% makes rem units far easier to calculate due to 62.5% equalling 10px. For example, 1.5rem is equal to 15px.

4. Preprocessing compiles CSS to allow for additional features that you would not otherwise have. Such as, creating variables to store commmonly used values. Font-size, font-weight, and hexadecimal values, to name a few.

5. Variables are by far the most useful concept in preprocessing. Mixins typically give the most trouble, as I am unable to find much use for them, beyond centering items.
