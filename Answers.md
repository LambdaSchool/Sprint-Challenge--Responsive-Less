1. An adaptive website has multiple breakpoints and a responsive design only adjust itself according to the width of the device

2. Desktop first is when you start going down to smaller resolutions and mobile first is when you start going up to bigger resolutions.

3. The size of the font is set to 62.5% because the font-size of most browsers is 16, and 10 is 62.5% of 16. That makes it easier for us to use rem units because now "1 rem = 10px"

4. Preprocessing is a better way to write css because it alows you to not repeat your code too much by using mixins and variables.

5. My favorite concept in preprocessing is parametric mixins because you can pass arguments to a mixin and can use it to make anything you want.
for example: you want to create a 3 buttons in different sizes, you can use a parametric mixin and give it the width the height that you want.
