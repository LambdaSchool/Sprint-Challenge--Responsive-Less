1 - An adaptive website will only only have one deisng that will adapt to the size of the screen. A responisive website has multiple designs created for different size screens and will switch to these designs using media queries.

2 - When you create a mobile first website, you start by desining the mobile site first concentrating on the mobile users experience. Then you create a larger layouts for bigger screens using min-width. Desktop first is the revers in which you start wiht the desktop design. Then you create the smaller layouts for smaller screens using max-width.

3 - 'font-size: 62.5%' in the 'html' tag sets all font sizes on you project to 10px. 'rem' units then act as a multiplie for you selected object. Example: 1.6rem = 16px.

4 - A preprocessor allows you to create your own resuable variables in CSS. It also allows you to nest your selected elements which means it will closer match your HTML layout. This helps your CSS be easier to read and maintain.

5 - I really like the nesting. It makes CSS more organized and easier to read. I'm still getting used to LESS and how to use the features it provides. Knowing proper syntax and keeping things organized has given me the most trouble.
