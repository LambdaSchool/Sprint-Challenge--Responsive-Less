1. A preprocessor allows us to futher enhance the functionality of CSS by adding mixins, functions, and nesting to simplify our code and make it much more readable. These preprocessers must eventually be compiled into regular css, however it is significantly less complicated to read when using something like LESS or SASS. 

2. "npm less -g" is the command to install LESS globablly. This is typed in the terminal/console.

3. There are a ton of mixins that we have used this week including trastions and animations. We also created our own button creator mixin at one point that we were able to use to make a button on the page. Mixins are customizable and allow us to simplify our LESS code even further.

4. A fixed layout is one that does not adjust when you change the width of the page or the veiwport. The content on the page is static and a horizontal scroll bar will be introduced when the content is wider than the window. An adaptive layout includes breakpoints for different widths, such as 400px, 768px, or 1100px via media querys. As we decrease the size of our window the content will adapt to the given veiwport and alter certain aspects of the content so they fit as the window is decreased. Fluid layouts use percent based widths to more responsively adapt to the user as the page is increased or decreased in size. Using percents allows us to be much more precise with our positioning and does not limit us to fixed pixel widths of containers.

5. Max-width allows us to create a laptop down design that we can alter as the size of the window decreases. Setting a max-width tells the browser that above this certain pixel width, we implement certain stylings. Typical breakpoints are 400px, 768px, and 1100px and we tell the browser to layout the page in a particular way at each of these points. There is also a min-width that allows us to focus more on a mobile up approach to our design. Regardless, we need max or min-widths to make our sites responsive at different pixel widths by setting certain styles to be implemented at these breakpoints.
