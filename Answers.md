1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Adaptive design - designing a website for different sized devices. The page itself changes depending on the size screen it's being viewed on.
Responsive design - The original content changes at different sizes. This allows a designer to makes changes at various points without having to worry as much about the exact size screen that it's being viewed on.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Mobile first - The page is originally designed to look good on a mobile screen. Then, as one moves away to larger screens, the design adapts to accomodate the larger size and will possibly not look it's best.
Desktop first - The reverse of the mobile first approach, the desktop is the main focus and the mobile version is the one that may not have the best view, in comparison.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units? 

It sets the base font-size to 10px, or 62.5% of the browser default, making it easier to adjust the font-size later because it's in a base-10 format.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessing is a method of structuring code to optimize the organization and efficientcy of the CSS. It allows for reuseable variables to be placed to streamline writing the code and allows for quick changes to design later.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 

The thing I love the most is organizing everything into discreet chunks of information that can be easily interwoven and adapted as the project progresses, i.e. saving colors and escapes in one concrete location. While I haven't had trouble with it yet, I worry about having problems with specificity. I understand specificity, but the flow of using multiple files may trip me up at some point.
