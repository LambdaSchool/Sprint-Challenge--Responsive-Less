1. Responsive is one design that changes to fit multiple screen sizes. Adaptive is multiple designs.
2. Mobile First means the default page layout is made for mobile screens. Changes are made to add more as page gets bigger. Desktop first starts at the larger size and removes things or modifies them to make the page smaller.
3. Setting font size to 62.5% allows the rem measurement to equal pixels. For example 1.5rem equals 15px.
4. Preprocessing is a 'plug-in' that allows you to add more functionality to CSS.
5. My favorite concept is mixins. Most difficult is nesting (which also isnt hard)
