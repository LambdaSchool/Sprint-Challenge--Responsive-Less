1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    Adaptive is based on break-points in the viewport allowing for different layouts per screen size. However it is limited to the size of the break-points set and is not able to adjust for any other screen size needed. This is where fully responsive comes in to play and allows you take advantage of break-points but is able to adapte to all screen sizes.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    Mobile first just means you are designing the website with mobile in mind first and then adapt the break-points later to work with desktop.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

    It sets the font size unit to be 10px allowing us to use rem more easily by not having to think to hard on the math of it.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

    Preprocessing is a way to allow easier scaling and maintaing ones CSS code.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

    Favorite concept is nesting.    

    No concept really gives me trouble. However I do have a hard time finding use for Mixins currently. I think this change once I work on bigger projects where more things are being repeated or may change consistently.
