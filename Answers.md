What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website? 
Adaptive website relies on predefined breakpoints to adapt itself to various screens. Eg:
@media(max-width: 500px){
  width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 20px;
}

Fully responsive website uses adaptive breakpoints and percentage based sizing for the optimal viewing experience of a website across any screen size. Eg:
@media(max-width: 500px){
  width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 20px 1.25%;
}

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS? 
Preprocessing take codes written in the preprocessed language like LESS and then converts/compiles those codes in normal CSS. Preprocessor uses features like variables, functions, mixins, nesting etc., to make CSS structure more readable and organized.



What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 
My favorite concept in preprocessing are mixins and nesting. I feel they save a lot of space and help CSS structure look organized. The concept that gives me most trouble is escape. It could be because I didnâ€™t make an effort to get familiar with this concept.
