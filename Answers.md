1. Responsive Web Design provides the optimal viewing experience of a website, no matter what type of device the user is seeing it on
Adaptive web design is different from responsive design in that there isn’t one layout that always changes. Instead, there are several distinct layouts for multiple screen sizes. And the layout used depends on the screen size used.


2. The biggest difference between the two is sizing. Another difference is websites that are meant for mobile devices load faster, they’re more user friendly, they won’t cut off  information, and avoid scrolling from side to side.


3. font-size: 62.5% changes the font-size to 10px, makes the resizing of the content much easier. 1 rem = 10 px. 


4. A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax. There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, and so on.

5. I enjoy variables, because I can easily change the color palette of the whole page.

Nesting somtimes can be confusing.
