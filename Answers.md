1. Adaptive web design is when the website has multiple designs on file for different devices/screen sizes to use when appropriate.Fully Responsive design is when the website has a singular design, but it is designed in such a way that it grows and shrinks to adapt to any screen size and still look visually appealing and be functional.

2. Mobile first vs. desktop first is about what viewing experience you are designing for first, and then optimizing the other designs after. With mobile design first, you design the layout and functionality for mobile experience first, and then design the desktop layout based on the mobile layout you created. When you design for desktop first, you do the opposite, designing for desktop user experience first and scaling to mobile after. Whether you go from a small screen to a big screen or vice versa determines whether or not you use max-width or min-width in your media queries.

3. The standard browser defaults to 16px being the base font that the website uses when all stlying is removed. 62.5% of 16 px is 10px, which is the more standard and readable size that is used. It also makes translating px to rem font sizes easier, for instance if you set the default to 62.5% then if you wanted 12px font you would set it t0 1.2rem. We use rem because it doesn't override user specific settings on font size as opposed to setting them directly as px or pt sizes.

4. Preprocessors are basically add ons to the original language(in this case CSS) to add in your own functions to make it easier to create lots of code and not repeat yourself, such as introducing classes and variables to a language that originally did not have them. You write code in the preprocessor file type, and you tell it while you are coding to watch what you are doing, and automatically translate it to it's original language and save it in the original file. You can edit the preprocessor code all you and and it's easier to read, and it takes care of translating and compiling the code to be used in your original file for you.

5. Thus far my favorite concept is variables/classes because they make it so easy to use the same section of code or same element over and over again, and easily be able to change them all at once when needed. The part that I am having the most trouble with so far is plugging preprocessor elements into a media query. I struggled a lot to get it working.
