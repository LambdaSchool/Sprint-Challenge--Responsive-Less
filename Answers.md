1. An adaptive website will have multiple distinct layouts for specific screen sizes. Elements will snap to a new size at certain specific breakpoints. A responsive layout will use a combination of percentage sizing and media queries to have certain elements smoothly resize to ANY screen size, fluidly. 
2. Mobile-first emphasizes optimizing a website for a mobile device user experience, then adapting it to larger displays using min-width media queries. Desktop-first design designs the layout for desktop browsers first, then adapts the layout for smaller devices after using max-width media queries.
3. It takes the default font size of 16px and reduces it to 10px, so that 1 rem equals 10px. This makes it easier to use rem sizing. So .1rem equals 1px, rather than the default scale where .1rem equals 1.6px. This is simply to create less confusion while designing a layout. 
4. Preprocessing allows us to design our stying and layout using a more logical language that allows all sorts of functionality that isn't native to CSS. for example nested elements, variables, mixins. It then translates the style into vanilla CSS stylesheet automatically. 
5. My favorite concept is mixins. I love the idea that I can just type a one-word variable that will easily recall complex chunks of layout, rather than copy-pasting a bunch of times. It also allows me to easily tweak the styling of similar elements without manually altering each individual object.
