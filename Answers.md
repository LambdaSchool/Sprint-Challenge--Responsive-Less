1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    The main differnece between adaptive and fully responsive websites is that adaptive websites rely on predefined screen sizes while
        fully responsive websites use media queries to display the content appropriately.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    Mobile first design would have the default formatting for mobile and then use min-width media queries to alter what is displayed for larger 
        screen sizes.  Desktop first design is for destop sized designs and then uses max-width media queries to scale down the website for 
        smaller screen sizes.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

    The 62.5% in the html tag allows the conversion of 1 rem unit to 10 pixels.  Example if you want a 20 pixel font size you would do 2.0 rem units.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

    Preprocessors make CSS easier to read and allow the creation of variables and mixins which make the CSS easier to change later.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

    My favorite concept in preprocessing is that variables and mixins can be used to change the code easier later.  The concept that still gives
        me trouble is that I don't feel that I use them as much as I should.
