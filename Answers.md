What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

A responsive website responds to changes in the width of the viewport at any point, whereas adaptive websites only adapt to changes in the width of the viewport at specific points.  Responsive websites tend to make use of percent-widths for their elements.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Mobile-first design means that you begin with a design for small, mobile screens and work your way up using min-width media queries.  Whereas a desktop-first design means you begin with the desktop's design, and then work your way down using max-width media queries.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

It standardizes the font-size across browsers, which means that when we use rem to set our font-sizes, we can be sure it will always amount to the same thing.

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessing allows us to write code using convenient shortcuts and tools that are not available to us with base CSS, and compiles it into base CSS for us.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

My favorite concept is the use of mixins, as it's extremely convenient for grouping vendor prefixes together, and making life easier when dealing with CSS code you're likely to repeat or have to modify with slight variations.  The concept that gives me the most trouble is probably escaping, as although I understand the concept, I find it difficult to understand the situations in which it is necessary.  This will require further study.
