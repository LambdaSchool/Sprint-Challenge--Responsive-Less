1. Adaptive will "adapt" to differnt screen sizes and display a differing result. Responsive will actively change the website as you change the screen size (allowing the content to "respond" to your actions)

2. Mobile first means you focus on the mobile aspect of your webpage rather than your desktop version and vice versa.


3. Sets rem units so they are easy to use (1.0rem = 10px, 1.2rem = 12px, 1.4rem = 14px, etc).

4. Preprocessing is a way to intro aspects of other programming languages (like variables) to make your code easier to read and change when you have large "unwieldy" projects.

5. Variables introduce a world of ease because of their ability to keep settings on the site confined to one file. Being able to change massive aspects of the website based upon one change is powerful.
