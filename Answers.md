## 1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
##### An adaptive website will have content move or change once a certain breakpoint is reached. A fully responsive website will keep the same content to screen ratio while the screen is being resized, up until major breakpoints, at which time, styles can drastically change.

## 2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
##### To be mobile first is to design and style your site to be viewed on a mobile device. All of your main styling will be done to look good on a mobile device. Breakpoints will then be used to make your site look better as the screen gets larger. Desktop first is the exact opposite. All of your main styling will be to make the site look good on a desktop, then breakpoints will be used to restyle at certain screen sizes.

## 3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
##### This makes the default font size 10px. This makes it really easy to use rem units because our minds think in terms of base-10 math. So if we want 16px font, we can give the font a size of 1.6rem.

## 4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
##### Preprocessing is what CSS seems like it should be when you first learn it. You are able to nest your selectors, create variables to be used anywhere in your CSS, and you can created blocks of reusable CSS using mixins.

## 5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
##### My favorite concept of preprocessing so far is the ability to nest selectors. This speeds up the writing of CSS. I have run into some issues of nesting too deep. I think going forward, my favorite concepts of preprocessing will be variables and mixins. Once I get a better idea of how and when to use them efficiently, the time it takes me to write CSS is going to go way down.
