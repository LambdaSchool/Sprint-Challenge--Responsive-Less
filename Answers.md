1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
   Adaptive websites are websites that have breakpoints setup for a different number of user screen sizes, but the issue with this is that these breakpoint designs are set in stone instead of actually dynamically responding to the user's viewport. Responsive websites are trully dynamic and acount for all viewports. Responsive websites use percentages to dynamically change elements of the website no matter the device that the user is using. In addition, breakpoints can also be used at different sizes to optimize the given viewing experience.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
   Mobile-first means that the developer works with the constraints and design of a mobile viewport(smartphone) as the default and then makes breakpoints for larger viewports. Desktop-first means that the developer works with the constraints and design of a desktop viewport(usually desktop PC) as the default and then makes breakpoints for smaller viewports.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?
   It standardizes the default font-size to 62.5%(10px) of the system system font-size which is usually medium(~16px). This way when using rem, the font-size of the page is dynamic and can change according to the user's system font-size, if changed.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
   Preprocessing is the act of using a different language with similar but more time-efficient syntax to allow for faster development time, which is then compiled into the base language for actual execution of the code.
   

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
   My favorite concept is nesting. Nesting makes the organization of code more tidy and makes it faster to run code. I would say parametric mixins were a little more difficult to learn.
