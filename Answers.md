What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
Adaptive has @media breakpoints but are not percent based.
Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
Mobile first means working your way up to wider breakpoints.
What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
It sets the default pixel size to be 10px. So you can just make a font-size without alot of decimal places.
How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
It is a great tool for doing your tasks more efficiently.
What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
It helps me get everything under control and it is not a pain to find something and change it.
