1.  with adaptive there are several distinct web pages for different devices based on specific breakpoints.  responsive changes fluidly as screen sizes change, so it can take longer to build, but generally provides a better user experience. 
2.  in the olden days everyone viewed the internet on a computer so websites were designed for desktop first, but as mobile computing grows and takes share mobile first becomes more relevant.  desktop first means that a designer will start with a larger format first and be thinking about max width and then use media queries for smaller formats, whereas a mobile first will be thinking about optimizing for smaller screens first and minimum width. 
3.  since rem is based on a root element it is tied to the font size in the element tag.  62.5% provides an easy way to size fonts in a responsive environment using percentages because it equates to 10px and then it can be easy to keep track and do the math in one's head in multilpes of ten if changing the size for a header for example. 
4.  a preprocessor converts one type of data into another type of data, which can be helpful in css because it allows us to implement more sophisticated techniques than css alone allows, like using variables and operators. 
5.  my favorite concept in preprocessing is nesting tags that more intuitively follows the flow of specificity.  i like the concept of parametric mixins also, but right now they give me a bit a trouble just trying to wrap my brain around the concept when we get a few levels in.
