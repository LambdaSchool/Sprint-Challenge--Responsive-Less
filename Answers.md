Question 1 - An adaptive website adapts itself to fit into various screen sizes. It relies on                 predefined screen sizes to adapt itself to resolutions across devices.
             A responsive website adapts to all screens across devices.

Question 2 - Mobile first means the developer begins designing for the mobile device first and                then adds features for the larger screen desktop version.
             Desktop first means the developer begins designing for the desktop first and then removes or rearranges features for the smaller screen mobile version.

Question 3 - Font size 62.5% in HTML makes it easy for the developer to convert to rems by                    making everything 10 based. For example 16px would be 1.6rem.

Question 4 - Preprocessing is a more robust form of CSS written in a different language.  It                  gives the developer not only more tools in the tool box but also more powerful                   tools for developing.

Question 5 - My favorite concept in preprocessing is the use of variables. I like that variables              make it so easy to change one thing across multiple pages so quickly.  The concept               giving me the most trouble would be a tie between flexbox and parametric mixins but              I will grasp the concept of both eventually. I will not be defeated by these                     concepts.  I will prevail! WAR CRY!!!!!! (I didn't get enough sleep last night)
