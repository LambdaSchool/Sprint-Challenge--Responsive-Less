1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
1A. A fully responsive website adapts to whichever viewport it is viewed in. Responsive is fluid and uses media queries. Adaptive sites are not and do not. Adaptive is similar, but different in that there are set layouts for each type of viewport. Adaptive detects what device is being used and a particular design for that particular breakpoint is loaded.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
2A. Mobile first designs for the smallest viewport first and works its way up in size. In other words, you optimize the site for a mobile device first and then work on higher resolutions, potentially up to desktop.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
3A. It changes the default font to 10px allowing for easier conversion. 10px = 1rem.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
4A. Preprocessing is like speaking a language, and using various dialects for that language. Preprocessors are essentially a dialect or different syntax of CSS that are compiled into CSS. Everyone that speaks English can for the most part understand one another regardless of accents and colloquialisms. This is the same for CSS and the various preprocessors. It may take a little time to learn the new syntax, but if you already know CSS, preprocessing is easy to pick up.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
5A. So far, I love everything about preprocessing! The only thing that gives me trouble is the lack of reps that I've got under my belt. Other than that, my understanding is solid.
