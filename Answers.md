 **1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?**
 An adaptive website has several layouts based on the width of the browser while a fully responsive website has a layout the responds to the current width, at any width, of the browser. A fully responsive website is also fluid as the browser changes width while an adaptive website will have more snapping from layout to layout.

**2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.**
A mobile first design is when you create the design in a mobile format first and then build from there into tablet and then desktop design. The idea for that is that your main visitors will be from mobile devices and so you'll want to cater to them first, and then go from there whereas desktop first design is when you build for your desktop viewers first and then move down the line all the way to mobile.

**3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?**
It allows us to have 1rem = 10px to make it easier to manage font-size.

**4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?**
Preprocessing makes life easier with CSS. It allows us to use less code (pun intended) in order to accomplish more. The idea is by using DRY (don't repeat yourself) concepts when doing the code. If you have multiple lines of code that you have to use in several places then you can use a single snippet to do that code everywhere you want. If you have a certain color scheme for the layout, you can set the website up to change the entire color scheme with the changing of only a couple of variables instead of having to go through the entire CSS file. It's a matter of taking stuff that could take hours to update and making it take minutes.

**5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?**
I haven't played with variables as much as I should, but I love mix-ins. I remember making one mix-in that was probably 10-15 lines that I was able to call with a single line elsewhere in the code a few times. And, since I haven't used variables too much, I feel like that is what is going to be giving me the most trouble. Practice makes perfect, right?
