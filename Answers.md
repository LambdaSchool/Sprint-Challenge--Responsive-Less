1.  An adaptive website adapts and morphs its size to fit its surroundings. Where as a fully responsive website stays the same size proportion no matter the size of the viewport.

2.  Mobile first means you build the website with a mobile user in mind, then build out the desktop view after that with media queries.

3.  Converts our default font-size to 10px

4.  Compresses your CSS into smaller and more readable code. As well as it organizes your code better.

5.  Favorite concept: Variables, especially being able to set the media query size as a variable.

    The concept that still gives me trouble are mix-ins. I just haven't found great places to use them yet with the projects being so small.
