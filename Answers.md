1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
An _adaptive layout_ means that the there are several versions of each layout that change based on the screen size of the viewer. _Responsive_ takes the best of both fluid and adaptive so elements will both change size and change to different layouts depending on the screen size of the viewer.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
Mobile first means designing a website that's mainly focused on functionality and then layering on extra elements and features as the screen resolution is increased. Desktop first means designing for the highest screen resolution. As the screen resolution is decreased, elements are either hidden, wrapped, or moved to accomodate the smaller screen size.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
It's a rule of thumb that allows the developer to specifiy size by dividing the size in pixels by 10 (or 10% of the original).

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing allows the developer to access extra functionality and organize CSS in a more easy-to-understand format.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
Nesting is probably my favorite part thus far. I think taking advantage of mixins is giving me the most trouble. The idea seems incredibly powerful but I don't think I'll fully appreciate it until I've used it a lot more.
