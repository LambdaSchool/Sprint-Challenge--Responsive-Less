4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, and fluid layout?
- Fixed layout is fixed width in pixel. Width stays the same regadless of screen size.
  Adaptive layout has few 'breakpoints' or rules i.e has different versions of the site, depending on them screen layout differs.
  Fluid layout size is specified in percents not in PX. So depending on the screen size, layout adjusts proportionally.

- It is breakpoint, if screen size exceeds set width, it rules no longer applies.
