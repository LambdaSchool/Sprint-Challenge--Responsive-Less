1. Responsive website respond to the size of the browser at any given point, where as the adaptive websites accomodate the browsers at specific points.

2. In mobile first the application is build first for a mobile device and made scalable for other type of screens, whereas desktop first website/app is developed for desktop and was made to scale for other divices.

3.`font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` provides the developer a reference point  when using `rem`. When set as such then 1 rem will be equivalent to 62.5% of the default font-size.  

4. Preprocessing is the use of CSS extentions such as LESS to incourage code re-usability.

5. Parametric mixins are my favorites for their ability to create a custom element without prescribing to the limitations of HTML. Example is the creation of `button.`
