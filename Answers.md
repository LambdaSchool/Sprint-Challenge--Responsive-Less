adaptive responsive design has several layouts for different sizes of the screen and responsive has one layout that changes constantly

mobile design allows a website to fit to screens of many devices automatically , where desktop builds for the complete features first then goes towards devices that require a different layout

preprocessing is the same as css but with the features of adding nesting with elements that are children to the parents and the ability to store used content in variables if it is used more than once

I enjoy the ability of the variables and mixins
