1.) The difference between adaptive and fully responsive websites are that adaptive sites use break points and look good at specific points, while fully responsive looks good at any size.

2.) Mobile first means your primary css styling will be towards mobile devices then your media queries will be for desktop using min-width. 

3.) font-size 62.5% makes the base font equivalent to 10px so we do our rem coversion math easier.

4.) Preprocessing will make your styling more efficient than css.
