Task 2: Comprehension Questions

1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    Adaptive websites set up optimum viewing at set screen widths, while fully responsive websites have optimum viewing at any screen width.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    Mobile/Desktop first describes the order in which a website is styled. Using mobile first, the styling is geared towards the mobile screen sizes first. Then other sizes are addressed using the min-width media rule. Using desktop first, the styling is geared towards the desktop screen sizes first. Then other sizes are addressed using the max-width media rule.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

    It set the rem unit epual to 10px and allows the user to dictate the text viewing size via the browsers settings.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

    Preprocessing is a way of writing styling code that uses features better suited for reusability, organization and readability. Once wrote and saved it is then compiled down to regular old CSS.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble

    It's a tie between nesting and parametric mixins. Nesting media rules is extremely efficient, while parametric mixins bring a function like strategy to writing styling code. I would say that nesting to deep gives me the most trouble. As I style like the html is written, I have a tendency to nest to deep.
