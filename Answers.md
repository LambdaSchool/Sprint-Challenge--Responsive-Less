1. An adaptive website promotes the designs of multiple styles of a web page that will fit the users device which is usually a smart phone while a fully responsive website is directed towards designing sites that will provide an optimal experience which includes easy navigation and reading.

2. To be mobile first would be to design the site to first be responsive to a mobile device before designing it to work on a desktop.

3. Using a font size of 62.5% in the HTML can assist in reaching a balenced and harmonius design.

4.  Preprocessing allows a person designing a page with CSS to have shortcuts in there coding. For example they can just refer to a setting mulitple times by using one word than typing many lines of code repeatedly.

5. I enjoy setting up the variables and mixins with preprocessing. Still working on the various types of mixins and when to use them.
