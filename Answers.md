1. A preprocessor is useful because it enables you to write cleaner and more concise CSS in a number of ways, including nesting, using variables, and running the same code over and over by way of mixins and functions.
2. npm install -g less
3. rotate
4. A fixed layout does not change at all based on the size of the window. An adaptive layout changes based on the size of the window, but only at specified breakpoints, resulting in abrupt changes. A fluid layout changes continuously as the window resizes, without "jumping" from one configuration to another at any point.
5. "max-width" is needed in adaptive layouts to break the possible widths of a browser window into categories and set breakpoints at which the layout will change from one design to another.
