What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Answer: In Adaptive websites, templates, layouts (and information) are pre-selected for different screen sizes. 
        Things are planned out in advanced and information is displayed based on specific devices (i.e., phone vs tablet). However, for Responsive websites, devices are detected with media queries and images are sized 
        correctly depending on the user's screen size. 
        
        In Responsive, there is only one template, unlike adaptive sites, which has many templates for many screen. 

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Answer: Desktop-first treats the desktop view as default, with mobile/tablet as add-ons via "max-width" media queries. 
        For Mobile-first design, the default is mobile, with tablet/desktop as optional add-ons via "min-width" media queries. 

        It comes down to design priority, in Mobile-first, the smaller screen size (~500px width) is prioritize and everything is in relation to this default.
