1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    -Adaptive web design has break points for things like tablet and phone views, but they do not respond until/unless they hit a break point. Responsive however WILL change/respond as the screen size increase or decreases without needing to hit/find the breakpoint to tell it to change. 

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    -mobile first means that the default CSS coding is for mobile views in mind and that you must use @media for those style to change for things like desk-top viewing. You use Width-min.
    Desktop first is the opposite and uses Width-max.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?
    -it allows us to use 1rem as if it was base 10 font size (so 2rem would be font size 20) but more importantly it allows our code to honor and obey the user settings if they are hard of seeing and have their text set up to be large, it will allow our content to accomadate their need and provide a better user experience. 

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    -Preprocessing is a tool that developers use to save time and write clearer code that is more DRY. By using a preprocessor like LESS it will allow you as developer to keep your code DRY, modularize sections for better organization, save a ton of time, and make it easier for future developers to make changes without going through thousands of line of raw css code. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
    -my favorite concept is moduarizing but it's also the one can lead to trouble if you don't keep on it. I love how to makes things easier to manage and saves me a ton of time on scrolling up and down hundreds of line of code. But if you're not careful I feel it's easy for it to "bite you in the @$$" however it's a tool that I do greatly appreciate being able to take advantage of.
