1.	What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website? 
Adaptive design uses predefined screen sizes and requires different layouts for different screen sizes and adapts itself to devices while responsive can be viewed by all screen sizes and uses media queries to adapt to different size screens without needing new layouts for many different screens that are available.
2.	Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first. â€“ 
Mobile first is design with the smaller screen size in the beginning then uses min width to increase screen size to tablet then desktop. Desktop first starts out as a larger layout then uses max-width to decrease screen size to tablet then to mobile.
3.	What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

 It makes pixel sizes easier to convert to rem units as it is in multiples of 10 for example 1.6 rem will be equivalent to 16px when font-size in css global style is set to 62.5%.
4.	How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing makes writing CSS code more intuitive and organized by using things such as nesting, variables, mixins, and imports then the preprocessor turns it into regular CSS code. 
5.	What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
My favorite preprocessing concepts are variables and nesting. The parametric mixin concept is most confusing for me.
