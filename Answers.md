1. Responsive layouts adapt to any size of window. Adaptive layouts change their layout when the size of the window hits a certain "breakpoint" ex. (width=500px).

2. Mobile first means you build the website starting from the mobile view of the website and build up to the Desktop view. Desktop view means you start from the desktop view of the website and build down to the mobile view.

3. font-size: 62.5% makes your 1 rem unit = 10px. font-size:100% makes 1 rem unit = 16px. We want 10px because it's easier to do the math that way.

4. Preprocessing allows a different type of syntax (grammar or way to structure CSS), a quicker and easier way to write code. It allows quick mass editing of CSS if you set it up your mixins and variables properly.

5. My favorite part of preprocessing is the nesting of CSS. Makes the code look cleaner and you can find everything in one place. The part that gives me the most trouble is probably nested mixins. Not too much trouble, but that's what I have to be most careful about.
