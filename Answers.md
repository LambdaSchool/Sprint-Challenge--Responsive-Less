What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    Adaptive websites stay the same until they hit a break point, their movement from one size to the other is very black and white. It is 
    the same content, size, and shape, until it hits that breaking point, then it changes, then it stays the same until the next breakpoint.
    While a fully responsive website is a mix of adaptive and fluid design. Using percentages to gracefully glide content across the screen
    to fit any screen size.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    Mobile screens are...typically way smaller than desktop screens, so If you start on the mobile you would have to start small and work
    your way up to larger designs for the desktop (using min-width). It is the opposite going from desktop to mobile (max-width). Desktop
    is usually what designers give developers to work from, simply becasue it is easier to style on a larger format.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
    When used, 62.5% will set the font-size default for everything with in the html tags to 10px. Its' like a reset.

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    Processing makes it easier to see the nested specificity of your code. By  allowing you to code in specific chunks of content, that is
    then stitched together in the end.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
    At first using Less was the most challenging thing, but I get it now, and I see how it makes "seeing" exactly how everything fits in 
    with each other easier. I like making mixins too, it's nice to only have to write a chunk of code once and then reference it later 
    with a simple one-liner.
