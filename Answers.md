If you had to teach someone with basic CSS knowledge what a preprocessor was, how would you describe it?
I would describe a preprocessor as a conversion machine that all css code goes through and comes out the other end compiled as plain CSS with the advantage of being able to use addititional features not found in native css.

What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, and fluid layout?
A fixed layout is what it sounds like and does not change when the browser windows is resized or is zoomed.
Adaptive layouts are responsive to the change between different resolutions and have specific breakpoints that modify code when a certain resolution is reached. This way the same site can look differently on both mobile and desktop.
A fluid layout combines the benefits of adaptive layouts with the ability to change on percentage as well as media query breakpoints.
Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width in a responsive website?
If you use a max-width then you are able to have other widths be percentage based.
