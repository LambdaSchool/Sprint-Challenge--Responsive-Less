1.)An adaptive web design is designed to fit into various resolutions across many devices. However, it relies on fixed screen sizes and several different   layouts will have to be made to account for all devices.  A responsive design requires only one template and will adjust itself accordingly to the different screen sizes through the use of media queries.

2.) A desktop first design is a layout built for the highest resolution and details commonly seen on desktop computers. A desktop site will be content rich and then adapt to smaller sizes through adaptive or responsive design. A mobile first strategy will prioritize focusing on the core elements of a web page and be optimized for smaller screens.

3.) Using font-size 62.5% in the HTML tag allows for easier calculations when converting font-sizes from pixels to rem by allowing us to use base of 10 calculations instead of 16.

4.) Pre-processors make life easier on a coder by allowing a user to use more common syntax to pass instructions into a compiler, which then converts and formats those instructions properly to be read by CSS.

5.) My favorite pre-processing concept is being able to use nesting like I do in javaScript. The most difficult part about pre-processing at first was the initial set up and functioning through git bash. However, after just a few days of using it, it has become a second language.
