1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

*   Adaptive website uses viewport breakpoints to adjust the website based on the users viewport size. Fully responsive uses the same breakpoints as adaptive but alos uses a fluid percent based layout as well to make the website move smoothly between sizes.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    
* Mobile first means you build a website using a mobile view first and later add on the desktop sizes using media queries.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

* This allows us to use whole numbers when using 'rem'. '1rem = 10px'

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

*   Preprocessing allows you to write CSS in the same nesting pattern that HTML is written in. It also extends the abilities of CSS to assist the user in writing CSS and keeping from repeating as much.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

*   My favorite part is the nesting ability. I also like using meaningful variable names for colors. Some of the more complex mixins are confusing and give me a little trouble.
