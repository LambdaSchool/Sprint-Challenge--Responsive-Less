#### What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

With an adaptive website there are several different layouts targeted towards different devices such as a mobile layout or a tablet layout and then a desktop layout. With a fully responsive website you'll see a layout that adjusts to work best for the device it's displaying on. One way to see a responsive website in action is to adjust the web browser window on a computer making it smaller or larger, if the website adjusts with the size of the browser window the website is responsive.
