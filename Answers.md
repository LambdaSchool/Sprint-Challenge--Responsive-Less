// 1. Responsive adjust to EVERY possible screen size, while adaptive only changes
      based on screen size presets. e.g. adaptive would fit to 1200px and 800px while
      responsive would respond to everything those resolutions and everything in between without having to create a media query for every one.

// 2. This one is pretty self explanitory. Desktop first means the base site design        revolves around a desktop size screen where as a mobile first site is                initially designed with the mobile site in mind. Starting with desktop you           need media queries for mobile and vice-versa.

// 3. Converts rem into pixel units of 10.

// 4. A preprocessor allows you to use, in a sense, simper languages to code in css.       It simplifies the css process by bending rules then taking that code and             converting it into css FOR you. Sort of like a translator.

// 5. I think my favorite concept in preprocessing is nesting. It just simplifies          the code even further and helps when re-reading over your code. I would say          looking into the inheritence selector has been pretty confusing, but I think         the more I read into it the simpler it will become. So as of right now I think       thats giving me the most trouble.
