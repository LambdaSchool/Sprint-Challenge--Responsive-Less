    1.What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    
    An adaptive website has use of media queries to make multiple layouts according to the device the user is using while on the site.

    In responsive design there is usually only one layout that uses a fluid grid system to shrink to size according the the pixel width. Responsive design also loads faster.

    2.Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    Mobile first starts small without the use of media queries in the min-width of 500px, then uses min-width media queries in pixel intervals of 800px then 1024px. Desktop uses max-width media queries when building down from the desktop width.

    Mobile first may focus on user experience for phone users to showcase an app, the same for desktop in its focus.

    3.What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

    It is like multiplying the base 1 rem unit (which is 16px) by 10/16 which gives us a base of 10px for 1 rem unit. So converting between pixels and rem units become much easier.

    4.How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

    Pre-processing takes an input by the developer which is the "less" based nesting technique, mixins, variables, and escaping syntax and consumes the "edible parts" then spits out what we know as pure CSS. 

    5.What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

    My favorite concept is the nesting that organizes the css properties into something that is readable like our html. The concept that is giving me the most trouble is escaping since it is new to me.
