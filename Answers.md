**1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?**
An adaptive website will have different layouts that occur based on the width of the browser while a fully responsive layout will have one layout that responds to the current width, at any width, of the browser. A fully responsive layout will also be more fluid in response to width changes while an adaptive website will have more snapping as it goes from layout to layout.
  

**2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.**
It simply means which way you build the website first. A mobile first design will start off with a mobile design and then move to a tablet design and then lastly a desktop design. A desktop first design will do the same thing but in the opposite direction.
  

**3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?**
It allows us to manage font size using rem much easier. Using `font-size: 62.5%`basically allows 1rem to equal 10px.
  

**4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?**
Preprocessing is the ability to make things easier. We can use less code to accomplish more. If we have a snippet of code that is used in multiple places then we can turn that snippet into a mix-in and put it wherever we want without having to type the same code over and over. It builds on the concept of DRY code (do not repeat yourself). We can also use variables to control things like layout themes, etc...
  

**5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?**
I love the idea of nesting. To me, it is much easier to nest css and control specificity while saving lines of code. I also really like mix-ins because I remember having one mix-in that had about 10-15 lines of code and being able to put it into different places without having to type it all in was awesome. I think the thing giving me the most trouble is trying to nest media queries only because I'm so used to just building the mobile and tablet designs using a media query by itself. I also haven't used variables much yet.
