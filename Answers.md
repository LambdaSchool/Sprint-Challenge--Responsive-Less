1# -    What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    An adapative website is a website that looks good on all devices. But a fully responsive website is a website that responds correctly on all screen sizes with 100% widths.

2# -    Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    Mobile first uses min-width and starts at a smaller breakpoint and goes higher for bigger devices.
    Desktop first uses max-width and starts a at the biggest breakpoint and gets smaller as the screen shrinks.

3# -    What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

    Its sets the font size to the dafault settings of the web browser.

4# -    How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

    Preprocessing is another languanges that compiles into css for easier readabilty and code managment.

5# -    What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

    I love that we can import files that seperate componets for easier code management.
    Understanding another persons code and understanding nesting sometimes trips me up.
