1) Adaptive webstie uses media query for different view port while responsive use both percentage for the width and media query for the view ports
2) To be mobile first is to develop webpage for mobile devices before desktop devices( using min width instead of max width). desktop first design the page to fit desktop view first then change it to fit mobile view.
