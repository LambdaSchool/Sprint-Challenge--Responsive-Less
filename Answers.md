What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

- Adaptive design is made for specific layouts like desktop, tablet and mobile. Responsive design is more flexible and fluid and can be viewed optimally on multiple screen sizes. Responsive design can pretty much work with any screen size if designed correctly.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

- Mobile first means to style the CSS from a mobile screen size first and then using media queries to design the desktop styles after. Desktop style is the opposite of that where you want to design your desktop styling first and then use media queries to style the the mobile version.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

- Preprocessing allows us to style CSS more effectively and efficiently. It allows us to generate CSS styling from the preprocesser's syntax and has added features that normal CSS dies not have.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

- My favorite concept is using mixins to repeat styles that I use over and over and that are tedious to type out each time. What's giving me the most trouble is nesting styles. It's not that big of a deal because I'm just new to using preprocessors and just need some more experience to get better. I used to have the same issues with structuring my html but now I feel like I'm a pro.
