Mobile first design scales from phone screens size up to desktop. desktop is the reverse of that.
62.5% is about 1 rem which is the starting size of the font we set. rem also lets the font adjust to the users browser setting.

My favorite concept is variables and mixins my least favorite is operators and functions.
