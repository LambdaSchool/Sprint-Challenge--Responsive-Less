1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

   An adaptive site has different layouts for different screen sizes. A fully responsive website is fluid and adjusts to the size of the screen. There are no breakpoints, the layouts will respond automatically.



2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

   In mobile first, you create a CSS or LESS file for mobile use, and then later add media queries to adjsut for desktop layout. In desktop first,  you create a CSS or LESS file for desktop use, and then later add media queries to adjsut for the mobile layout.



3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

   62.5% ensures that the rem font size default is 1rem = 10px.



4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

   I'd describe preprocessing as a way to reformat CSS with a nesting style so it's easier for developers to use and manipulate. It also adds features allowing for a more DRY coding process. The processor converts the LESS file into normal CSS so browsers can view it without issues.
   


5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

   I like the concept of escaping for media queries, but sometimes get hung up on parametric mixins.
