1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
An adaptive site uses break points to change its look based on screen size but can be flawed with horizontal navigation bars. However a fully responsive site uses a mixture of percents,breakpoints, and wraping to allow the user to have a pleasant expierience no matter what size of screen they have.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
Mobile first is when you design a website to be on mobile devices first but you then use min-width to make the site look good on desktop and tablet.
Desktop first is the same in the fact that it is made for desktop users and it uses max-width to adapt to other size screens.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?
It makes the base font size 10px so it is easy to turn px into rem.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing is the process of writing in a different syntax or code that makes it easier to style webpages. The code that you write is compiled into normal CSS so you don't have to worry about any isssues.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
My favorite concept about preprocessing is the variables and mixins they are both very useful shortcuts to take while writing CSS, also how you can have multiple less files that all convert into one using the import tag . I don't really have anything bad to say about preprocessing.
