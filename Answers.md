1. Preprocessors is a must have tool for css development that helps achieve writing reusable, maintainable and extensible codes, increasing productivity and decreasing the code in a project.

2. "npm i less-watch-compile" in terminal

3. I used .opacity to give a slight blur. The color was red but the opacity made the image look a little pink.

4. Fixed layout - static/fixed pixel width that is programmed not to move and stays the same independently of screen size or resolution.
   Fluid layout - sizes are in %, proportion of elements stay the same if the screen size changes.
   Adaptive layout - several versions of layouts displayed based on screen size of viewer when the screen size is within range.

5. We do that because a user viewing from a phone or tablet would view the site with different resolutions as opposed to a laptop/desktop, by setting breakpoints the sites would be optimized for the end user.
   @tablet: ~"(max-width: 768px)" // in this case, the width will trigger when the resolution is 768 and below until the next breakpoint.
