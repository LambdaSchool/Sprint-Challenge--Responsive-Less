1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
An adaptive website is built with breakpoints to account for various screen sizes. A fully responsive website is built with percentages and rems in addition to breakpoints to be fully responsive with one master layout.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
In mobile first design, media queries and sizes increase as the page bottom approaches. In desktop first design, media queries and sizes decrease as the bottom approaches. The biggest difference is specificity.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
Turns the font-size into a base ten system rather than a base sixteen.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing is the process of writing CSS in a different but similar language that is then compiled into actual CSS. This allows for variables, mixins, functions, etc.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
Escaping is my favorite concept because it allows for cleaner code. Parametric mixins is my most troubling because of the line between parameters and arguments.
