What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

A responsive website is a site that uses fluid grids to give an optimal view of the page, no matter what the device they are viewing it on. Adaptive websites use different breakpoints to show up best on different devices (such as breakpoints for phones/tablets/desktops).


Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Desktop first means to focus on and design the desktop view before adjusting or focusing on any other viewpoints. Mobile first is the opposite: focusing on the mobile experience before expanding into desktop.


What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

It sets up your code so that 1 rem is 10 pixels. 2rem would be 20px, and so on.


How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

A preprocessor eats everything and spits it all back out into more digestable and organized bits.


What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

The variables make coding easier, especially the media queries. I'm still getting used to the parametric mixins, but I think I'm getting them figured out.
