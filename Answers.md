1. Responsive websites literally respond to the actual size (width) of the browser at all points. So as the user changes the viewing device or the dimensions of said viewing device the browser width will condense or expand appropriately. Adaptive websites, on the other hand, change the layout viewing based on the given dimensions of the viewing device at any given time. A good mathematical analogy for me is that adaptive websites have discrete points at which the layout will "adapt" to accomodate the user while response websites have a continuous spectrum or infinite variations of a given layout based on the user's viewing preferences.

2. Mobile first is essentially a workflow from the smallest possible viewport to the largest possible viewport (the "desktop"). Desktop first is the inverse.

3. It reduces the font size to 62.5% of it's unit amounts in rem.

4. Preprocessing is like attaching a small Javascript library to your code that compiles to beautiful CSS, so you don't really have to read through 1000 lines of CSS for a 50 line HTML file anymore it's great. Just learn the Box Model and move on with your life, it's not worth the stress.

5. I love mixins more than anything. Variables are awesome, and I appreciate what they do for readability, but mixins serve the greatest utility for me personally by drastically reducing the amount of CSS I have to read through which is the most beautiful thing I've seen so far in LS. Nothing about setting up the systems or using them is ever really troublesome for me, but I still suck at designing cool things. I'm working on it; I promise.
