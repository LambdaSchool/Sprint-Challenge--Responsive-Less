 fully responsive website is able to be viewed in mulitple platforms while an adaptive website is only 1 layout and many would have to be made depending on device being used.

 ? if not mistaken is to make responsive website easier to make ? 

 its make 1 rem = 10 pixs thus making easy to do rems mathimaticly. 

 think of it like premade parts for a car, you get the engine but you dont have to build it from scratch starting with the screw, you instead get the engine and build into the car, still hard to do but saves a lot of time.

 i like preprocessing mostly about the orgazition part but one can get lost so im going back and forth a lot.
