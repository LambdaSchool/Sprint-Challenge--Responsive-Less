What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

An adaptive site adapts its self to fit into various screen sizes by using a predefined screen size. While it is very user friendly, we have to develop multipe layouts for different devices. A better alternative is fully responsive. It allows us to use media queries, therefore we only have to create one master layout and our website will look great across multiple break points.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Designing for mobile first means your media queries break at a minimum width and your main CSS is designed for mobile, while desktop first break at a maximum width and the main CSS is designed for desktop.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

It allows to make simple 1rem:10px ratio calculations.

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preproccessing is a program that allows us to organize complex CSS as well as generates new CSS from its own syntax. It also brings more features that Vanilla CSS doesn't have on it's own.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

My favorite concept is organization of code and reduction of HTTP requests. I don't think I am having any issues but I am learning more about it every day.
