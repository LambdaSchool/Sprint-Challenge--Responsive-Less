x  What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Responsive websites respond to the size of the browser at any given point. No matter what the browser width may be, the site adjusts its layout (and perhaps functionality) in a way that is optimized to the screen. 

Adaptive web design is different from responsive design in that there isn’t one layout that always changes. Instead, there are several distinct layouts for multiple screen sizes. And the layout used depends on the screen size used.

Desktop first design
This approach means designing for the highest specifications — the best achievable by design- and then going down to smaller resolutions.
