1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

A fully responsive design is fluid. It works on any device size and uses CSS media queries to change styles based on the display type, height, width or other characteristics. Adaptive site designs however, use static layouts based on certain breakpoints that don't respond once the page has loaded. Adaptive designs load based on the screen size and are based on common widths. Adaptive designs are less flexible, but the can be easier to plan and build because you have the specific width the site should be displayed on. 

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

With desktop first design, you build your site with everything that is going to be on the largest browser version, then as you move down to smaller devices you display only the most important content that should be on those smaller devices. Mobile first designs are just the opposite, you first start with the design of you mobile site and add on features that will be displayed on the larger tablets and desktops as the screen sizes get larger.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

Having a font-size set to 62.5% allows us to have the measurement of 1rem set to 10px making it an easier unit to work with when coding projects. 

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

CSS preprocessors allow you to write CSS in a more time efficient and affective way. CSS preprocessors add certain functionalities such as variables and operators, that you would not have access to if writing in just plain CSS. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

My favorite feature of preprocessing would be the ability for us to have variables and built in functions. The hardest concept for me to grasp would probably be the escaping in Less.
