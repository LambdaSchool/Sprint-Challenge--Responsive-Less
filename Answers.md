1. An adaptive website uses media queries as breakpoints for its layout to be viewed on screens of different widths; a fully responsive website incorporates both fluid (%-based widths) and adaptive (max-widths/ media queries) methods to build a seamless experience across all devices and screen widths.

2. Mobile-first starts with the design for a mobile screen, and uses min-width media queries for wider and wider screen widths down the cascade. Desktop-first starts with the design for a desktop screen, and uses max-width queries for smaller and smaller screen widths.

3. font-size: 62.5% makes the base font-size for the entire website 10px; this makes it easier to calculate rem-conversions in order to make the website more adaptive and accessible (e.g. for people who need larger font sizes).

4. It is another language that adds extra tools and functionality to the given vanilla CSS language. It is compiled (interpreted & translated by the computer) into CSS for the browser to render.

5. I especially enjoy parametric mix-ins. They're extremely useful for me with reusable property groups, (e.g. flexbox properties and box-model properties).
