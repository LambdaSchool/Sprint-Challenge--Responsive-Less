1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

An adaptive website will change at breakpoints but isn't necessarily fluid so it basically has several different layouts depending on the browser width, a responsive website is a combination of adaptive and fluid meaning that it uses breakpoints but also responds as the browser at any width and uses percentage based layouts to look good on any screen.  Responsive is the most optimal design for a website.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

With mobile first you design the site with the mobile layout as the priority, you can us min-width for media queries so as the screen gets larger the layout will respond accordingly.  With desktop first it's just the opposite, where the desktop layout is the priority and you can use max-width for media queries so as the screen gets smaller the layout responds.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

It changes the font default to 10px so that if you want something to be 12px you can use 1.2rem.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessing is a tool that makes css more efficent and modular.  There are features like varibles and mixins so that you can reuse parts of your code and avoid repeating yourself.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

I like how modular and organized the code is.  Variables and mixins make everything more efficent and its easier to have DRY code.  I haven't had much trouble so far other than getting used to the syntax.
