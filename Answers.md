1. A website made with responsive design is one that adapts its form based on the device the user is currently viewing it on. The overall structure of the site looks more or less similar regardless of which adaptation is being viewed. An adaptive design of a site has distinctively different versions of the same site for different viewports or devices.

2. Mobile first is a site that is designed with the mobile layout in mind and then later adapted into larger formats, while a desktop first site starts out large and is scaled down to smaller viewports.

3. It changes the scales to be base 10, meaning that the default unit of 1 rem is equivalent to 10px, as opposed to the typical 16px. It makes it easier for the developer to do quick math when adjusting font sizes and the code is easier to read for other devs.

4. Preprocessing is a method of writing CSS in a more intuitive and productive way with the aid of a few additional tools. It increases productivity and overall code readability, while not changing the final result for the worse in any way.

5. Mixins in preprocessing are the most exciting for me, there is just so many possibilites and I have a thing for efficiency, and DRY code is very appealing to me. The most troubling is also the concept of mixins, but not due to their difficulty but because as a newbie I feel like I don't see the possibilities of the potential mixins I could create right away, but I should be able to with more experience.
