Adaptive has different layout for different screen sizes, it doesn't have one layout that changes automatically depending on the screen size. Responsive changes automically depending on the screen size.

The difference is in which one the main code starts with. Mobile first is first coded for the mobile phone and then changes are added for tablet size then desktop size. The desktop first is the opposite - where the code begins with desktop, then changes are made for tablet then mobile.

It makes it easier to convert px in rem because one rem equals 10px. This makes it easier to do the math to convert the px into rem.

A preprocessor converts one type of language into another. Like LESS converts to CSS. LESS makes coding easier and faster because you do things like declare variables for often used values, and make mixins for code that is used often so you are not repeating yourself all the time. 

My favorite feature in preprocessing is the variables and mixins because it saves time and you can change values so much easier - you don't have to look through entire code to find each font-size for example. The one that gives me the most trouble is the import feature because it can be confusing with multiple pages to open depending on where you are in the web page. But I do see the value in it and will definitely like it when I get used to it!
