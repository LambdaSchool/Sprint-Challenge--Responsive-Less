1.	What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
Responsive website uses fluid grids to adjust the content to any screen which allows optimal viewing regardless of device that the user has. Adaptive website on the other hand delivers separate content based on the device they have.

2.	Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
Mobile first: min-width. (can’t be smaller than the specified value)
Desktop first: max-width. (can’t be larger than the specified value)

3.	What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
Makes it easier to calculate our pixel units converted into rem. For example, if I had 16px, it would be 1.6 rem. (16 divided by 10)

4.	How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
CSS, as a language has its own feature set, which at times might not be enough to create a clean and reusable chunk of rules. of being able to reuse a collection of rules in multiple selectors, unavailability of variables which may lead to ambiguous pieces of data across the stylesheet.
To overcome most of these limitations, the concept of a preprocessor was born – offering an advanced way of writing CSS, which extends the basic functionalities. A preprocessor also outputs your CSS file.

5.	What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
I have found that using a pre-processor like LESS has definitely helped me understand my code a little better. It has given better structure to our code and has also helped me detect errors that I would have otherwise not found if I am just using vanilla CSS. The one I am having trouble the most is just getting used to the complexity that goes with pre-processors. There is so many things you could do with it and I think I just have to wrap my head around everything I learned.
