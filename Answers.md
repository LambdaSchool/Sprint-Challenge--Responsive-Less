1.Adaptive web design is different from responsive design in that there isn't one layout that always changes. Instead, there are several distinct layouts for multiple screen sizes.

2.Mobile first means your base styles are designed for a mobile page and your media queries will scale up as you build other versions.

3. A font-size of 62.5 sets the default size to 10px which makes it very easy to manipulate when using rems.

4.It's a different way of writing your CSS that is supposed to make your code simpler to read and easier to organize. Your code is written with a preprocesor then compiled using something like Node and the compiler outputs regular CSS which your browser uses to interpret your design.

5. My favorite concept is nesting, I think it's incredibly simple and easy to implement effectively and my least favorite would be having to keep a compiler running in terminal.
