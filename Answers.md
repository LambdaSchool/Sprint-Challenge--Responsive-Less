1. If you had to teach someone with basic CSS knowledge what a preprocessor was, how     would you describe it?
- CSS is complex because it is older than most languages, so writing CSS code can get confusing really quickly. A Preprocessor (like Sass or Less) is a syntax built by very nice people to make writing CSS code much more simple/ clean.
2. What is the command in node package manager (npm) to install LESS globally on your    computer?
- sudo npm install -g less
3. Please provide an example of a mixin you have used in a project this week.
- I used the .opacity mixin. When added to a class this mixin would give that class a default opacity of 0.5 .
4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, and fluid layout?
- Fixed layout does not change even when you resize the window.
- Adaptive layout means the page has several different versions for diffierent sizes (in our case we used phone, tablet, and laptop).
- Fluid layout means the proportions are set in percentages instead of pixels. So when you resize the window, the elements will adapt proportionally.
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width in a responsive website?
- Because max-width shows how big the element can get, otherwise, it will grow without any limit and make a complete mess.
