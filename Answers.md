1. The difference between adaptive and fully responsive is that adaptive has several layouts that alternate based on the viewport and other parameters, and fully responsive has a single layout that adjust naturally.

2. Mobile first means to design and online experience for mobile devices before designing it for desktop.

3. So using the '62.5%' makes '1rem = 10px' which makes it very easy for us to increment our font size's.

4. I would describe 'preprocessing' as having a collection of preset styles for your code, and there are several options when it comes to having preset styles.

5. My favourite part of 'preprocessing' is having a some sort of styling already in place so when i start coding i can focus more on getting everything on the page and kinda figure out how i want it to look before i have to touch the css.
