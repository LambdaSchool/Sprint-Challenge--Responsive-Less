1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

		Adapative websites have different code for each breakpoint. Usually designed with static units (ie px.), whereas responsive websites change based on size of viewing screen. They are designed with dymanic units (ie %).

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

		Mobile first means the website has been designed with mobile users in mind first and subsequently adds parameters to follow on desktops. Desktop first is the opposite. The developer designed the website for optimal view on destops and added separate parameters for mobile after. 

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

		It makes every 1rem equal 10px. It allows the developer to determine what font sizes to use for their elements, instead of using the browser's default, which can vary across different browsers.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

		Preprocessing allows you to input one type a data and covert it to CSS. In the case of our class, we are learning Less, which allows us to input variables, nest elements and use javascript and the preprocessor converts it to standard CSS.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 

		My favorite concept is variables. Mixins are giving me the most difficulties.
