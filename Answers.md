**1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?**

Adaptive websites are based upon pre-set view sizes, with designs for each size. Responsive websites are more fluid, and adjust seamlessly between different viewing conditions.

**2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.**

Mobile-first is the strategy of creating all design for the mobile device initially, and changing the layout/content incrementally as the viewport increases in size ('progressive enhancement').

Desktop-first means that you design for the larger-viewport user first, and then add changes to your design files to reflect a shrinking viewport ('graceful degradation).

**3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?**

This sets up the work environment so that when using `rem` units, 1rem is equal to the height of the default font-size (usually 16px).

**4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?**

Preprocessing is a system for combining and nesting similar CSS code snippets using an intuitive approach. It also saves a ton of typing.

**5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?**

I love mixins- it's great to be able to supercharge a design from one place, rather than having to go all over my CSS code.

Not a concept, per se, but jumping between multiple .less files to assemble one CSS file at the end of the day was a bit challenging. I understand the usefulness of a modular .less setup, but it can sometimes be confusing where things went.
