1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Responsive websites have one design that provides an optimal viewing experience on multiple devices. 
Adaptive websites don't have one layout that changes; they have several distinct layouts for multiple devices.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Mobile first means that you start building a mobile website and then adapt the site to desktop. Desktop first is vice versa.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

This sets the normal default font size (16px) to 10px. We can use REM units to make the font responsive and accessible to people that
would like to change the default font size. 

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessing is a way to shortcut CSS code and reduce the error rate from the developer. With prepocessing you can use mixins
to save time as you no longer need to re-write code and if you make a mistake, the termianl will direct you to the error. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

It's not exactly a concept but I love the fact that the terminal directs you to the exact location where you've made the error! It
saves a lot of time. 
I find escaping slightly confusing; I can see that it's slightly more readable to have media queries nested within the elements
but I think it's also helpful to have all the media queries at the bottom of the LESS file in one place. Perhaps after I've used it more
I will be converted.
