1. Q.What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website? 

A. An adaptive website creates multiple versions of the page to fit a users device, whereas a fully responsive website adapts to different screen sizez with the use of media queries.

2. Q. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.  

A. Mobile first is to develop the website from the beginning with mobile in mind using the base css as the mobile design and using min width media queries for other devices. Whereas desktop first would be to develop the website with the main css being used for the desktop design and using max width media queries for other devices.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

A. It allows the website to be more accessible to people, and lets them change their settings on the browser which in turn changes the pages text sizes.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

A. Preprocessing allows you to write cleaner css with added features and functionality to help make things easier for you and then turns what you write into normal css.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

A. My favorite concept in preprocessing is the ability to use nesting and use less lines of css to make things look much cleaner to look over. The concept that gives me the most trouble would be the more advanced mixins, as they can get pretty crazy to understand at first.
