1.What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Responsive design creates a greater user experiance by having the website automatically respond to the size of the screen.
Adaptive layouts are static lay outs that are based on breakpoints so you would have to create several screen layouts for multiple screens.

2.Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

When doing mobile first you generally start with a min-width and go bigger in regards to the min-width. You create for the mobile viewing experience first.
Desktop is the opposit where you start with a larger screen and scale downwards. You would use a max-width at the begining and just going smaller in regards to the max-width.

3.What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

Using 62.5% in the html tag sets the font size in the root element. So all the elements that us a unit of rem will go baseed off of the root element.
If we wnated to quickly increase or decrease the font size of the entire project, we would just change the root elements font-size.

4.How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preproccessing allows you to decrease the amount of code that you are writing and makes a lot of the styling for your selectors reusable. It makes your code much easier to read and keeps it looking organized.

5.What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

My favorite concept of pre-processing are variables. The concept that gives me the most trouble are mix-ins. I'm just not comfortable with adding in parameters because I'm not sure when I would use them effectively.
