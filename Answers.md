1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    An adaptive website will shift it's layout at different breakpoints. You'll pretty much create three or four different layouts for different devices. Responsive is one layout that responds to any shift in window-size. Neat-o!

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    Designing a website to be mobile-first means designing it for phones ahead of desktops. Designing for desktops means the opposite. Mobile-first uses min-width and Desktop-first uses max-width.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
    It changes the font-size to 10px across the page to make it easy when converting to rem units. 10px = 1 rem, 11px = 1.1rem, etc... Just divide by 10!

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    People got a little tired of writing the same lines of code over and over again in CSS, so they started using preprocessors to help with that. There's reusable code that is also easier to maintain.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
    My favorite concept is having a mix-in or variable that we can easily change. For example, if we get bored of our h3 colors, we can go in and change every single one of them, assuming we used a variable for their color.

    The concept that gives me the most trouble that we went over would probably be parametric mix-ins, not necessarily understanding them, but just wise practice of how much things to allow someone to alter to not have it be too confusing.
