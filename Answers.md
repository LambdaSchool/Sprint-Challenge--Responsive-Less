#Answer One:
> An adaptive website is one that supports multiple viewports, but is still fixed widths. A fully responsive site is a site that does more than adapt, it fluidly adjusts to the viewport size, usually/typically after setting a max-width and width of 100 percent.
#Answer Two:
> With a mobile first approach, one starts from a small viewport using a min-width rather than max-width, and works their way from the ground up, rather than top down approach used with max-with for desktop first. Mobile users are a large percentage of today's website users, and learning this approach (mobile first) is beneficial to the future of the web.
#Answer Three:
> A `font-size: 62.5%;` applied to the html element of a CSS or LESS document, enables a sort of size "_hack_" where `rem` sizing can easily be set using a faux pixel representation. Example: `font-size: 0.1rem;` is equivalent to 1 pixel, and `font-size: 1.0rem` is there for equal to setting the size to ten pixels, in child elements of the root element.
