1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website? Both forms of web design attempt to accomodate for multiple devices simultaneously. An adaptive website uses pre-set layouts that do not change once initially loaded. For example, an adaptive website initially loaded on a desktop would not automatically re-size if the viewport was scaled down to mobile size. In contrast, a responsive website would automatically resize without needing to refresh the page.
2. Both are methods of responsive web design. Mobile first: The bulk of the code creates the design for mobile-sized screens. Media queries incorporate the `(mid-width: )`property. These media queries change the styles as the viewport size exceeds that of a phone. Desktop-first: The bulk of the code creates the design for desktop-sized screens. Media queries incorporate the `(max-width: )`property. These media queries change the styles as the viewport size shrinks beyond that of a desktop computer.
3. It creates a 1:10 ratio between `rem` and `px`. For example, `1.6rem` would be equivalent to `16px`.
4. Preprocessing does not change the way you write CSS. Through the use of variables and a more visually semantic method of specificity, preprocessors can make CSS more readable, convenient, and reusable for current and future developers.
5. My favorite concept is also the concept that gives me the most trouble: the multitude of files imported into the `index.less` file. I love it because it creates meaningful organization, and I can easily separate my website into semantic components in my CSS. I hate it because I have been learning that my code is not very organized due to bad habits formed while I was self-teaching.
