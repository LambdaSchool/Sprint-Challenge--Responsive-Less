1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    Adaptive websites provide layouts for a variety of devices while responsive provides an optimal view no matter the device. 

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    Mobile first design assumes a mobile experience as the default display view, then cascades up to larger viewing experience from there, while desktop first design does the opposite, starting from an assumption of the desktop being the default experience, then cascading the design down to smaller devices from there.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units? 
    It simplifies the math when converting from pixel to rem, making it so that 1rem is equal to 10px instead of the usual 16px.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    Preprocessing is a concept that allows a language with streamlined and compacted syntax to compile into CSS. This allows the developer to quickly create complex CSS layouts in a more simplistic and rapid manner.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 
    Mixins and variables. Nesting.
