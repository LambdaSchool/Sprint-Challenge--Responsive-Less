1. Adaptive sites have multiple layouts that switch at different
resolutions while a fully responsive site looks good a every
resolution. 

2. Mobile first is the process of designing and building
a web site with mobile viewing experience in mind before scaling 
up to other viewport sizes

3. CSS Preprocessors are like super powers for CSS
They add a bunch of useful features to make css a more
intuitive experience. 

4. I find nesting I use nesting and variables the most
since they are pretty intuitive and make css a lot
easier to deal with.
I have the most trouble with coming up with good mixins,
I'm sure its a process that happens with refactoring.
