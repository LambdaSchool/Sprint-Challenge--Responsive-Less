Responsive Web Design gives a optimal viewing of a website, no matter what type of device the user is seeing it on while Adaptive Design uses multiple layouts for different screen sizes.

Mobile first vs desktop first is the practice of formatting a web page for mobile and working your way up in terms of reformatting and resizing to fit larger screens.

Usually default font-size of the browser is 16px. so that makes calculating rem difficult. So if you set your html font size to "font-size: 62.5%" it becomes easier to figure out: 1rem = 10px as opposed to 1rem = 16px.

Preprocessors are tools that allow someone to write CSS in a more succinct way. It allows you to reuse code easily and if a change needs to be made you do not need to fond every instance in your code to change. If you used a variable for instance for a color, you only need to change it once for it to effect the whole page.

I love the variable especially when using it for media queries. I am still getting the hang of using it with parameters.
