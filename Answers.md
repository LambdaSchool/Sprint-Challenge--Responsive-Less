1.) Adaptive website detects what time of device you are on and displays a pre-made layout specifically for that device. Fully responsive has one layout that changes based on screen size.

2.) Mobile first means that your CSS is styled to fit mobile devices (by pxl size) by default and then adapts/changes style if you access the page from a desktop.

3.) Reducing font-size to 62.5% gives you a 1px to 1 rem ratio, making math easier.

4.) Preprocessing is being able to write code in an easier to read/navigate way and using a "translator" to put it into the basic format of code that the computer can read.

5.) Preprocessing allows the use of nesting and shortcuts, both of which I like. The biggest trouble is just not having used it enough yet. Right now the idea of putting code on different pages, depending on which part you want to write, and then importing to LESS, to then compile into CSS, seems like a lot of steps, but also seems very organized.
