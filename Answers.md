1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Adaptive only has preset layouts. It detects the screen size, and shows the page that has been built for that resolution.

Responsive can constantly change the webpage for any resolution. Usually built with widths as percentages.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

It is built using 'Min-Width' in mind. It is built for mobile first, then break-points are built in for the larger screen sizes.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units? 

It allows us to use `rem`, which is responsive to the users set font size in their browser.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessing is using JS to utilize CSS, and preset styling to make mass changes easier.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 

My favorite concept either has to be nesting, or mixin's. The concept that has given me problems has been nesting. I have learned how to use it now, but it was stumping me for a while.
