mobile first means that you design for smaller screen sizes first. Desktop first you design for the largest screen size and work your way down.

    preprocessing allows for you to write css in a more intuitave and dryer way, and allows for better organization. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

my favorite conccept is mixins, I like how it speeds up the process by allowing you too write dry code.
none of the concepts really give me any trouble. I suppose just remembering the syntax is the hardest part.
