1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    * The difference between adaptive website and fully responsive is with adaptive design adapts itself to various screen resolutions that are predefined. This has a disadvantage because with this technique you have to create multiple layouts to cover various screen resolutions and one can't cover all the resolutions available because there are some screen resolutions that are odd but exist. Meanwhile responsive design provide a precise viewing experience across all devices. An advantage of this from the adaptive layout that the responsive design uses one master layout so it will load faster. 

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    * Mobile first focus on the mobile experience being the best as possible without ignoring desktop users. This is the preferred method because as studies show most users are mobile these days. Desktop first focuses on making the desktop experience as best as possible without ignoring the mobile.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

    * This is a neat trick (thanks Dan) that makes rem very easy to use since we are taught to use pixels first. Every 1 rem is 10 pixels so 1.2 rem is 12px.
