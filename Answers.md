1) What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    An adaptive layout uses multiple HTML codes depending on the device you use, but is difficult and unweildy because of how
    many different formats have to be typed up based on the size of the viewed screen. A fully responsive website loads faster
    because there is only one master html, but take a long time to format, test, and debug before that website can go live â€“
    still, it is the most popular type of website used by businesses, today.

2) Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    Whereas to be "desktop first" you cascade your CSS/LESS to be optimized for a desktop screen down toward a mobile screen, the
    opposite is true for "mobile first:" You cascade up (cascade down in reverse) from a mobile screen to a desktop screen.

3) What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
    It usually sets the font's size to 10px (1rem), whereas the mainstream size of 1.6rem would be 16px (font-size: 100%).

4) How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    Preprocessing is using a program to take one type of data and converting it into another type of data.

5) What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
    My favorite concept of preprocessing is importing; it allows me to divide each section of a website into easier to read
    and handle .less files while maintaining a strict flow format. The concept that gave me the most trouble was applying
    media queries to namespaces, though I was able to learn how to properly apply them.
