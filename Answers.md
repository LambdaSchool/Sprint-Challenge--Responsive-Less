Addaptive is building the css portion of the sight to adjust its layout and elements to the viewport and changes in viewports without the use of any breakpints. this is usually acheived with the use of a percent based layout.

Responsive web pages are created with the use of both a ercent baased layout and breakpoints for phone and tablet viewports in addition to a destop layout.this makes the website fully responsive and visually apealing at every size.

Moble first is  starting the a web dev build with the moble layout first. thin min-width :400px/500px to begin with. then building out the tablet and desktop versions after.

Desktop first is different in that it starts the build with the desktop versions of the project then uses max-width media quieries for brak point adjustments for tablet and phone viewport ui interfaces after.


Using font size 62.5% allows us to have a set ratio for 10px === 1.0rem; It lets us use rem in an easily convertible way without the extra math/ calculations for conversion done in the past.


Using a compiled version of css to help make websites faster nd the code more intuitive with less repetition. preprocessing also has many features not availible in vanilla css to keep code DRY (without needless repetiton). 

My favorite is the mixins and namespaces. THe euseablility and project to project costimizability makes css quicker more fun and interesting.

Nesting while using the atom text editer was the worst paart of this experience. i had to switch over to vs code just to easily see the nesting tree in my editer. Otherwise preprocessing is fun.
