Mobile first means that your media query will be written using mobile layout first and min-width

A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax. it is more like css but ends with an extension less. it is also converted to css once you run your file. 
less offers nesting, mixing,.. and so many things

the one that I am concerned about is functions such as (darken and lighten)
