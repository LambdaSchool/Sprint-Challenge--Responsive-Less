4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, and fluid layout?

A fixed layout is a layout that is built with fixed pixel sizes or dimensions. An adaptive layout is a layout that is built to be viewed by multiple devices, and the content will change its form depending on the device used or the size of the browser window. A fluid layout is a layout that will change its form fluidly across all devices or changes in browser window sizes.
