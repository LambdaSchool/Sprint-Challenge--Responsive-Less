# H1 Questions
1. **If you had to teach someone with basic CSS knowledge what a preprocessor was, how would you describe it?**
..* well, I’ll feel  like a quick feynman method describe to CSS always beneficial, so what is CSS? “Cascade style sheet” is  very simple text file includes the *colors* , *background or anything can tell the browser how you want to render or simply show this plain HTML or another text hold the structure of the website.
..* LESS on the other hand come to organize and help maintain components or  simply parts ( *menus* , *buttons*, *fonts* …) of the website to be used again and again through the life of the website.

2. **What is the command in node package manager (npm) to install LESS globally on your computer?** ..* I recommend for the quick development and to include the pre-processor using the free CDN  ``` <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/less.js/2.7.2/less.min.js"></script> ``` *the head part* but for production use download (npm or yarn) a downloader for less on your node.js server using the command ```npm install -g less``` *-g* means globally! And run the watcher ```less-watch-compiler less css```  which is an simple on demand or on refresh update the status of the the final CSS after being compile or interpolated! The code to run the LESS compiler is ```lessc LESS.less CSS.css```

3. ** Please provide an example of a mixin you have used in a project this week. **   ..* personally I used the mixin to gather **gradients** from all vendors and my favorite 3 types and look ex: ``` .gradient(@degree360; @colorRGB; @start; @colorRGB; @end;)```
4. **What is the difference between *fixed* layout, *adaptive* layout, and *fluid* layout?**  ..*fixed or static website layout is when you choose that the website width will be fixed aka the container so whatever the user using to visit your website it will show one type of width no matter the screen size or resolution. And most importantly required horizontal scroll on small devices. ..*Fluid used the *%* percentage for the main-container or wrapper making the whole website adjust based on the size of the screen leaving sometime problems with uncertainty with images sizes or other real-time data, but its removes the horizontal scroll and user-friendly. ..*elasitc or the adaptive layout is using *em* as a measurement for hight & width and em is the 16px used in a fontFace.
5. **Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width in a responsive website? **  
..* to know if the max width reached to hide and adjust the layout to handle a smaller screen size.
