1. The diffence between an adaptive website and a fully responsive site is that an adaptive site has one layout that always changes and a fully responsive site has mutiple layouts(ie mobile, desktop) that changes on a particualr screen size.
2. The difference between mobile first and desktop first is with mobile first your media quuries will be for the desktop view. In other words you design for mobile size and then add desktop views through media queries.
3. Seting font size to 62.5% allows us to base rem units 10 and not 16 so it's easier to work with.
4. Preprocessing allows you to use functionality not normally included with CSS and then compile those files(.less) into standard CSS.
5. My favorite concept is importing. I like being able to seperate code out into logical units. I would say that my most trouble comes with Maps. Just a little trouble seeing when to use and why.
