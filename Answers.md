1. Responsive web design aims to create a website that delivers a good user experience across a full continuum of screen sizes. Adaptive web design had a discrete number of page layouts that load depending on the type of device the browser detects the user is using.
2. A mobile first website is built with the mobile screens considered first before desktop (larger) screens. In practice this means min-width media queries are used rather than max-width to create break points.
3. Setting font-size: 62.5% in the html tag reduces the default font-size of the browser. This default is usually 16px, so 62.5% reduces this to 10px, which then makes for easy math when using rem units to adjust font-sizes. For example, with font-size 62.5%, a particular font-size of 1.6rem would be 16px.
4. Pre-processing allows the developer to write code in a file separate from the CSS file, using more intuitive and powerful  syntax (e.g., nesting, variables, and mixins). This code is then compiled into CSS (assuming the right compiler is being run) to create CSS code that styles a webpage.
5. My favorite concept is mixins. It's incredibly powerful to create styling "funtions" that take in multiple arguments. The thing that gives me the most trouble is the multiple less files because I don't want to lose track of code, but ultimately it makes everything more organized.
