* If you had to teach someone with basic CSS knowledge what a preprocessor was, how would you describe it?
A preprocessor takes one language and converts it into another. In the case of LESS, it takes the CSS-like code in a less file and converts it into a css file that can be understood by a browser.

* What is the command in node package manager (npm) to install LESS globally on your computer?
npm install less -g

* Please provide an example of a mixin you have used in a project this week.
.opacity, .transform, .transition, .scale, .skew

* What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, and fluid layout?
A fixed layout has a fixed width in pixels and does not change relative to the screen size. An adaptive layout has several versions and displays the one that matches the viewer screen size. Fluid layouts are specified in percentages so that the proportional size of the elements changes as the screen size changes.

* Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width in a responsive website?
Max-width allows us to set breakpoints at which the layout adjusts based on the screen/view size. This lets us specify changes to the layout for different device types, such as laptop, tablet, and phone.
