1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    Adaptive has several layouts that change depending on the screen/device you are using. Responsive has one layout that adjust to the screen of the current screen/device being used.


2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    Mobile first designs a website with the majority of the design coded for the mobile users then adjusted for the destop users. Desktop first is the opposite.


3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

    It allows each rem unit to equal 10px. This allows a much easier human interaction with rems. (ie. 1.6rem = 16px)

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

    It enhances and allows for easier code writting to css

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 

    I like the nesting ability because it is a time saver.
    Importing and working with multiple .less files is a bit confusing when hunting down a problem.
