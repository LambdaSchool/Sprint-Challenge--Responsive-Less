Adaptive websites consist of multiple breakpoints in which a website will work on different screen sizes, but doesn't allow much in the way of dynamic movement in between those set sizes. Fully responsive sites adjust ratios and are able to stylistically scale between many different screen sizes.
In mobile first, you're desgining your app or site to be used on a mobile device first and foremost and then adjust your original design as you size up towards desktop. You do this with media queries using min-width. Desktop first would be the exact opposite of this. You start with your desktop site and scale it down to mobile. This is achieved with max-width media queries.
Setting font-size to 62.5%, allows you to use rems in a 1:10 ratio with actual font-size. On a browser set up with 16 px font, 62.5% would take it down to 10px font, which equals 1 rem. So at this point any rem number you enter would be multiplied by 10 to give you pxs. Using rems also allows text scaling if someone has adjusted their default browser text size.
Preprocessing allows us to format our CSS in more meaningful and logical ways. Through it we can create variables, mix-ins, and use nesting, almost as a javascript/html hybrid. It allows us to be less repeatable in our CSS. It is then the preprocessors job to translate our LESS CSS into traditional CSS for us.
So far, I'm really enjoying both variables and the nesting that LESS offers. I still am having some trouble with mix-ins. Perhaps it's just the nature of these smaller projects, that they don't seem totally worth it yet.
