1. What is the difference between an daptive and a fully responsive website?

    Responsive websites respond to the user and their screen size at any point or size, where as adaptive
    websites adapt the screen size at certain breakpoints or certain screen sizes only.

2. Difference between mobile first design vs. desktop first design.

    In mobile first you design for the mobile screen size and user experience first and work your way up
    to bigger screen sizes throughout the CSS. But desktop first is the opposite, where you layout the page
    starting with the bigger screen size, or desktop experience, and work your way down in the layout of the CSS to mobile. 

3. Font size of 62.5% in HTML tag -- what's the purpose when using rem units?

    It sets up the font-size to equal 10px, so that every rem unit is epauls 10 px. This makes it easy to convert to
    both rems and percentages since it makes units divisible by 10.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

    It is a slightly different language than CSS but it allows for cleaner code and less errors because it takes smaller
    snippets of code and is able to compile them into one big CSS file.

5.  I think my favorite concept of preprocessing is the ability to use variable, mixins, and to nest stlyes. It makes
    for a way moe fluid codinf experience for me, because I feel like I can more competely focus on one section of the HTML at a time.
    I think the the media queries still trip me up a little. I don't know really, since the work in the end just like
    regular CSS media queries do, but I think they are the part I struggle with the most. ? I don't really know why.
