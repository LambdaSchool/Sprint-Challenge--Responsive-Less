An adaptive website is the creation of multiple web pages to fit each screen size. A fully responsive website is the abiltiy to create just one webpage that adapts to each screen size. 
Mobile first is creating css that starts at the mobile size and works its way up to the desktop size, where desktop first is the opposite in that it starts at the biggest screen size and works its way down to mobile. 
When we set our default font-size to 62.5%, it allows us to understand that our default font size is 16px or 1rem.  This way when we want to change to other font sizes we know how much 2rem would be or how to make a smaller font size. 
Preprocessing allows you to take elements created in your css that are repeatedly used and make just one that can be simply inserted when needed.  Preprocessing also allows you to have just one section of code to modify or fix when needed instead of each time it is used inside of other elements. 
My favorite concept is nesting, I enjoy the fact that you can have just one section for each part of your code and all code that goes inside it is right there for you to easily find.  The concept that gives me the most trouble would be mixins, as I was having trouble understanding exactly how to word the information inside them and make it work on a webpage.
