What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Responsive: this page responds to the size of the browser viewport at any given point and not at specific breakpoint only.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
Which one is used as a starting point. If desktop first is used, then for the @media rules, max-width wil be used. On the contrary, if mobile first is used as a starting point, then min-width is used.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
It scales the default browser setting of 16px to 62.5% of it, meaning to 10px, in such a way that now 10px = 1rem.

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing is a set of rules that make up a program that allows to input data in a way and obtain resulting data in another format for better programming purposes. For example, LESS is a preprocessor language that uses Javasscript compiling properties to write CSS code in a .less file using rules that are easier to follow and as a result the actual CSS code is compiled or written to a .css file in a way that the computer can understand.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
My favorite concept is nesting. It is somewhat intuitive and allows to better navigate the code to a html structure. 

The concept that gave me a little bit more trouble was nested-at rules with parameter, specially because I had to follow different files to determine what was the variable I was assigning.
