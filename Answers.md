1.	What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website? Fully responsive websites adjust to any size at points.  Whereas an adaptive website adjusts to widths at specific break points. 	
2.	Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
Mobile first applies to min-width vs desktop first applies to max-width.
3.	What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
It allows accessibility for those who need to have a larger or smaller font so that it applies across browsers. 
4.	How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing allows a more time efficient way to write CSS and it allow things to be more customizable and easier to access by using mixins or variables. 
5.	What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
I would say being able to build mix-ins and using them at a later time while writing CSS. The concept that gives me most trouble is the use of media queries as well as parametric mixins.
