	1.	What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website? 											Adaptive websites have distinctly different layouts for multiple screen sizes. Responsive sites respond to whatever size the viewing screen is to provide optimal viewing experience at any size. 
	2.	Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first. Mobile first layouts are designed around the mobile viewing 		experience and respond to increasing screen resolutions, desktop is the reverse starting with the desktop build. 
	3.	What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?												When you set the font size at 62.5%, you establish rems in a base ten where 1rem is equal to 10px.  
	4.	How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS? 	Preprocessors allow you to write many lines of code in a more short form way and outputs fully functional css. 
	5.	What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? I like nested media queries and escaping because they make it so that all media queries are nested within their own elements. Keeping the syntax of less straight, especially with mixins.
