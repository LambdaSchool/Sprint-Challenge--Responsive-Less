Responsive websites respond to any given browser at any given point while adaptive websites adapt to the width of the browser at a specific point. 

mobile first refers to developing the website with mobile devices in mind as opposed to desktop fitrst which has the desktop version in mind when developing. the main difference is that you would use min-width in your media query for a desktop site after finishing developing your mobile site. You would usually use max-width when developing for mobile after the desktop is completed.

font-size: 62.5% allows for 1rem to equal 10px.

Preprocessing is basically writing CSS in a diferent language that alows for new techniques and styling options but it will still get compiled back into CSS at the end of the day.
