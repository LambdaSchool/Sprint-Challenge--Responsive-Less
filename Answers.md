1. If you had to teach someone with basic CSS knowledge what a preprocessor was, how would you describe it?

*  I would describe a preprocessor as a package that allows the user to add logic to their CSS, in the form of variables, functions, mixins, and so forth, wherein it is easier to both create and maintain the CSS for the project.

2. What is the command in node package manager (npm) to install LESS globally on your computer?

*  npm install -g less

3. Please provide an example of a mixin you have used in a project this week.

*  A mixin personally used was the scale mixin, which allows the use of the scale CSS property in conjunction with adding all appropriate vendor prefixes.

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, and fluid layout?

*  A fixed layout has set dimensions. When the screen of the user's device is not large enough to accomodate these dimensions, the browser will create vertical and/or horizontal scroll bars to allow the user full access to the material rendered. Adaptive layout uses media queries to respond at specific break points. Fluid layout always adapts to the browser, no matter the dimensions. In these adjustments, both layout and functionality may be affected.

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width in a responsive website?

*  Max-width must be used in a responsive (fluid) layout so that the size of the page does not exceed design limits, and can be scaled accordingly on smaller devices using percentages.
