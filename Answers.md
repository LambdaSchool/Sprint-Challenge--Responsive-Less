1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
An adaptive website is one that works at different screen sizes, like desktop resolution, tablet and phone.
A reponsive website is one that the design layout works at any and all screen sizes.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
Mobile first means that the website is designed to look good on a mobile screen first, then designed up to tablet, then desktop.
A desktop first is designed in the reverse order. Desktop, then tablet, then phone. 

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
Changing the font-size to 62.5% will make it so that it will be easier to translate px to rem, by making 1 rem equal to 10px. 

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing is a way to make the design flow more intuitive, by being able to nest your css in a similar way that it is layed out in HTML. You can also use it to control sweeping changes to your site, and asign variables in order to tag specific elements that you use often, instead of writing them out normally every single time you use them. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
I like every aspect of preprocessing. I like how you can nest your elements the way they are layed out in HTML. I like how you can create variables to tag specific colors or commands. I like how you can create a single parametric mixin instead of copying and pasting over and over again. The hard part is reminding myself to use it. It's always an after thought, instead of pre-planing.
