1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    * The difference between adaptive website and fully responsive is with adaptive design adapts itself to various screen resolutions that are predefined. This has a disadvantage because with this technique you have to create multiple layouts to cover various screen resolutions and one can't cover all the resolutions available because there are some screen resolutions that are odd but exist. Meanwhile responsive design provide a precise viewing experience across all devices. An advantage of this from the adaptive layout that the responsive design uses one master layout so it will load faster.
