1. Responsive websites are smooth adjustments, it resizes to the browsers width at any given point. Adaptive is more of a snap adjustment, it will resize to the browsers width at certain points only.
2.When you design a website as desktop first you are designing it to display as much content as possible, think wider and have more of an immersive website. Mobile first is writing more of a functional website. It focuses on
designing with just the essentials, it focuses more on the important content.
3.font-size:62.5% makes each rem equal 10px.
4.Its using something called a compiler to help you create cleaner, more readable code in your css. It helps with not having to repeat your code over and over again, and it helps to visually organize your code more.
5. My favorite preprocessor concept would have to be being able to use variables as as a styling guide. I notice that alot of my code tends to repeat so being able to set it to a variable will make it a lot cleaner and I'll follow that DRY concept better.
