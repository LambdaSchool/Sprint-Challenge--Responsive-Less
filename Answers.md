What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
    By setting font-size to 62.5% we make 1rem = 10px and that's much easier to use for conversion of units.
How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    Preprocessing is a step that makes writing our CSS much simpler and easier as developers. It allows us to use certain things like variables, mixins, etc. that make CSS writing much more efficient and then the preprocessor can take our code and convert it into the requisite CSS.
What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
    I enjoy being able to create mixins and namespacing as it simplifies a decent amount of my code writing, especially for flexbox. I can't think of one concept that gives me more trouble than any of the others, conceptually preprocessing seems very straightforward which i appreciate.
