1- Difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website:
  Adaptive website have to adapt the styling based on a specific viewport, so it can get difficult to take all the sizes into consideration.
  Fully responsive website uses media queries and width percentages to cover a range off sizes, making it easier.

2- Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
  Mobile first: You start your website design the way you want it to look on a mobile window (small). You use media queries to style the website when the screen becomes bigger. Use (min-width: ---px)
  Desktop first: You start your website design on a big screen and you customize it with media queries going to smaller screen. Use (max-width: ---px).

3- What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
  IT makes it easier to make the font-sizes flexible. 1rem would be equal to 10px instead of 16px.

4- How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
  Preprocessing makes writing css more intuitive using nesting, closer to the way HTML tags are written. Also, it uses variables and mixins to avoid having to repeat styling and makes it easier to make modifications later on.

5- What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
  Favorite concept is the variables because it makes it much easier to make changes to styling without having to go through the whole css file.
  The concept that gives me the most trouble is mixins. Knowing when to use them instead of using classes requires some thinking.
