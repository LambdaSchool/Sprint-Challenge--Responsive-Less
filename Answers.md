What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

An adaptive website is set up with different design files to be displayed at different breakpoints only.
A fully responsive uses adaptive design in combination with fluid design, and percent based layouts to fit screen-sizes in between breakpoints as well

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Desktop first uses max-width in CSS to set break points and uses the desktop design as the default styling.
Mobile first uses min-width in CSS to set break points and uses the mobile design as the default styling.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

It balances the scale so that 1rem = 10px font

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessing is a way to incorporate basic programming concepts, such as variables and nesting, into a CSS file. It is done through compiling the PREprocessed
file into a processed CSS file.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
Everything about it, minus having to compile. Nesting, variables, and mixins allow for easier readibility, scalability, and DRY coding.
