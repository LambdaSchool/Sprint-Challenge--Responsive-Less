 A Responsive website take sin account for diferent screen sizes. It use breakpoints and percatages to make the website look good no matter what screen size it is on. Adaptive is easier to make but does not always look good at every screen size.

 Mobile first you will start with min-width. All the mobiles css will be at top and when it is time to create the desktop version you'll start adding below.

 Font-size 62.5% is for useability and for being cross browser compatable.  62.5% is 10px which is equivalent to 1rem.

 Preproccesing is an add on to CSS  so you can add sfeatures that don't exist in the CSS world. (mixins, variables) it also makes organizing things a whole lot easier.

 My favorite concept is nesting in CSS, I got lost in all the lines of code trying to find what i was looking for. with nesting, you know exactly where everything is nested. My biggest trouble is mixins and variables. I have a basic understanding but it taks me longer to make the mixins and variables correct.
