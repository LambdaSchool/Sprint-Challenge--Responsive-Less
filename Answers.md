1. Adaptive web design is different from responsive design in that there isn't one layout that always changes. Instead, there are several distinct layouts for multiple screen sizes. And the layout used depends on the screen size used.

2. Mobile first means to design the CSS with mobile in mind then designing the tablet and desktop in media queries.

3. Usually default font-size of the browser is 16px. Setting font-size: 100% will make 1rem = 16px. But it will make calculations a little difficult. A better way is to set font-size: 62.5%. Because 62.5% of 16px is 10px. Which makes 1rem = 10px.

4. Preprocessing allows the developer to better organize their CSS. It adds additional features that introduces variables and 'mixins' that give you the option group regularly uses css properties.

5. My favorite concept of preprogramming is the usefulness of splitting files and not having to scroll past the reset CSS header. Nothing seems too confusing. Trying to use parametric mixins with CSS animations gets hairy for me though. So many arguments to remember.
