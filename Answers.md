1. An adaptive website has breakpoints where the content layout will change based on the size of the screen displaying the content. Fully responsive will adapt the layout at any size of screen.

2. Mobile first is a site that will adapt as the screen size increases. Desktop first adapts as the screen size decreases. Mobile will use 'min-width' with the media query and Desktop will use 'max-width'.

3. Setting font-size: 62.5% enables us to use rem units effectively. The rem units will be 'normal px size'/10. So instead of putting "16px", we can use "1.6rem".

4. Preprocesing in CSS gives us the ability to more effectively organize and maintain the code. It enables us to use variables, mixins, functions, and nest our code. It can greatly increase productivity by letting developers use a more effective syntax in the code than native CSS allows. 

5. I really enjoy the nesting. It makes the CSS so much clearer for me. My biggest issue with this week has been the adaptive design and making sites look good on both mobile and desktop. It is what I have spent the most time on this week.
