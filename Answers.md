1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    Although both adaptive and responsive websites accomodate for different sized screens, fully responsive also changes the layout and position of certain elements to ensure a good user experience and read ability.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    In mobile first you design the mobile site first and then you scale up. With Desktop first, you design the Desktop site first and then you scale down.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?
    It makes every font size 10px and then when you change the font size using 'rem', it makes it easier to control because it would be like multiplying the rem number by 10. A couple examples would be 1.6rem = 16px, 2 rem = 20px.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    Preprocessing is a tool that allows you to write CSS in a more efficient way because it allows for the use of Variables, Nesting and Mixins. This allows you to avoid having to write the code over and over again, meanwhile the nesting allows you to properly organize the structure of your CSS, thus avoiding confusion.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
    My favorite concept in preprocessing is the parametric mixins and the nesting. I had trouble with the syntax of it at first but I understand it now.
