1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?  Adaptive design focuses on the need of the user and uses a progressive enhancement technique to design the web pages. Adaptive web design adapts itself to fit into various screen resolutions. Adaptive web design relies on predefined screen sizes to adapt itself to resolutions across devices.  Responsive website design is the most suitable type of web design style and the most popular in todayâ€™s time. It provides precise viewing experience of a website to the user, adapting to all screens across devices.
*Adaptive: Breakpoint based on viewport but also very rigid.
*Responsive: Fluid + Adaptive = all bases covered from phone to desktop.
