1.  An adaptive website merely change the layout as the viewport reaches a breakpoint where as a fully responsive webpage uses percentage based layouts and breakpoints to allow it to dyanically change as the viewport increases or decreases.

2.  Mobile first means to begin building the wesbite as a mobile layout and using min-width as the breakpoints. Desktop first is the reverse where the website is first built in its desktop layout and uses max-width as the breakpoints.

3.  font-size: 62.5%; makes the rem units convertible to pixels by power of ten. So a rem unit of 1.6 would be exual to 16 pixels. 

4.  Preprocessing uses a language like LESS that allows you to do things more intuitievly and mimic the layour of html in terms of hierarchy. It then becomes processed into normal CSS which the browsers can read.

5.  The hierarchy and nesting is by far my favorite thing in LESS. It makes it much cleaner and easier to read. Parametric mixing is probably the most trouble causing of concepts, mostly because I don't think about it until the project is done and then I end up ham-fisting it into the project.
