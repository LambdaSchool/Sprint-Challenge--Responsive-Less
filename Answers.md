1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Adaptive allows itself to adapt to various screen sizes but relies on predefined settings while fully responsive will allow users of any screen size to view the website flawlessly using percentage based layouts.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Desktop first will use a max-width property in their media query while mobile first uses min-width.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

It allows use to use rem with a base of 10, so 1 rem would be equal to 10px

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preproccessing allows us to code a website using less, sass, etc then converting the .less file into a .css file that the browser can read. Less will allow us to use functions that aren't normal available within CSS.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

I like how everything is organized very well, the part I really do not like and wish to do differently is how we use media queries within the code. I feel like either we should use a new .less file or put media queries to the bottom as they just make the code very hard to read.
