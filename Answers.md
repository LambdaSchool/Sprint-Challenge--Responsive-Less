Adaptive changes based on the viewport/ screen size of the device it is being viewed on.
Fully resposive is like adaptive but accounts for all the screen sizes inbetween and is fluid between break points.

Mobile first focuses on designing for smaller moblie screens then expands outwards for larger screens like tablets and laptops and desktops. Instead of using max-width, one would use min-width in designing.

Using `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag kind of normalizes font size ratios so that when you use `rem` the conversion is more intuitive. Ex: 16 pt font would be about `1.6rem`.

Preprocessing is a way to write CSS in a more sentatical or logical way. It makes organizing and reading code more simple and legible.

I like the concept of mixins because they are like objects you can apply to multiple lines of CSS. I like the idea of namscapes, but I don't know that I would use them so much currently. Maybe in the future though.
