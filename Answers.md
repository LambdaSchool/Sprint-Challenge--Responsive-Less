1. The main difference between the two is that responsive websites use media queries to change the layout of the page based on screen size, while adaptive websites don't. Adaptive websites don't look good when you switch between the different breakpoints, whereas responsive websites do since they adjust at the breakpoints. 

2. Desktop first means that you are first starting the design of your website with the desktop version. The main structure of your CSS will be based on the desktop layout, followed by the tablet and mobile media queries. It's the opposite if you're doing mobile first. In that case everything will be for your mobile site, followed by tablet and desktop media queries. For desktop first, you use max-width media queries, but with mobile first, you use min-width media queries.

3. When you put a font size of 62.5% in the HTML tag, you make the root of all your fonts 62.5%. That way when you use the rem unit for your font sizes, it will be an easy calculation. For example, 1rem will be 10px, 1.5 rem will be 15px, 2rem will be 20px, etc. Using rem for your font sizes isntead of px makes your website more user friendly for those with special needs.

4. If I were to describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS, I would say that it is basically a more logical and easier language similar to CSS, that gets converted into actual CSS code through git bash. You download a preprocessor like LESS, SASS, etc, run a command in your git bash, use the preprocessor syntax in its file to do all your CSS, and then it gets 'translated' into your CSS file.

5. There's a lot I love about preprocessing, but I think the thing I love the most about it is the nesting. It just makes sense to have everything structured like you would in an HTML file. Variables and mixins are really great too, but for the projects we've been doing, they aren't super necessary. I think variables and mixins would make more of a difference in bigger projects. The thing that bothers me the most about preprocessing is the use of so many media queries. Sure, it's great to have them in a place where it makes more sense, rather than at the bottomm of your entire CSS file. But the downside to this is that you'd need media queries for every single place that you want to make a change, which can get kind of annoying.
