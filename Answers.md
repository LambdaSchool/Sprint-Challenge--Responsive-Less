1. An adaptive website uses media queries to have differenet designs for specific devices. A fully responsive site uses media queries and percent based design to create a design that works on all devices at any different break point.

2. Mobile first means that mobile styles are in your base CSS then views for larger screens are built out using media queries.

3. Using font-size: 62.5% in the html tag resets the base font value to 10px because originally font-size defaults at 16px but 16 \* 0.625 = 10, changing the default font size to 10px. 10px is equivelent to 1rem.

4. Preprocessing is a tool used to make CSS more friendly for developers. Instead of writing one big CSS file, you write your CSS is different chunks. These chunks are then compiled into one big css file. Once you get it set up it makes your life easier!

5. I really like the modularity that nesting provides in combination with using imports to keep different components seperated. The concept giving me the most trouble is probably mixins. I like then, but I also am still getting the hang of when it's best to use them.
