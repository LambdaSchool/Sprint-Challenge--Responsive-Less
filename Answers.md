## 1. The Difference between an adaptive and a fully Responsive Website

Responsive web design provides an optimal view no mater what device is viewing it. Where ar adaptive web design implements several layouts each for a specified size / device profile using @media to give break points to the design.

Responsive web design requires a more stringent look at the css of the site and a great attention to ddetail is needed to give the user a fully responsive experience. Adaptive web design is concerned with a lower set of specification in such a way that it is easyer to design and develop as it can be as generic as having 1 or 2 break ponts for a desktop, tablet and mobile view of the website.

Responsive websites do load a little faster due to there only needing to be one layout loaded as opposed to an adaptive site requiring several layouts to load in to allow the break point scenareo.
