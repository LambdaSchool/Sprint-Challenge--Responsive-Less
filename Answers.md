# 1) A preprocessor lets you write CSS in an easier to understand and easier to use fashion, and then converts it into normal CSS that
# can be used by the browser.
#
# 2) NPM install less -g
#
# 3) A mixin is sort of like a variable that holds reference to a set of css properties to be nested inside another div/element. I've used
# mixins as nested properties, so if I wanted to apply specific media max-width for a phone or tablet I would put those property changers (mixins)
# in the relevant spaces.
#
# 4) A fixed layout never changes. Adaptive is built with breakpoints, while fluid is built with percentages.
#
# 5) Max width is used when building desktop -> phone as breakpoints
