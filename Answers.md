1.) 1.	What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?  On Adaptive the breakpoints are based on viewport but also are very rigid.  responsive user both fluid which uses 100% of the viewport and adaptive so all bases are covered from phone to desktop.

2.) Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.  When you develop for mobile first you are making all your design to fit smaller devices and scale up to desktops since the world we live in is alwasy on the go with their smart phones.

3.)	What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?  It allows for persons with disabilities to be able to scale up or down on their devices and still allow for a design that is desirable on the screent.

4.) How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?  A preprocessor is a program that takes one type of data and converts it to another type of data. so takes in code that you can store like variable and compiles it down so it can be reused later.

5.)	What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?  For me I like the fact of storing variable and I like Mixins, now, having said that I'm still struggling with Parametrix Mixins.
