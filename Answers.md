1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Adaptive website adapts itself to fit into the various screen resolutions but it relies on predefined screen sizes to adapt in multiple deice. This means that every layout has to be created for each screen sizes needed.

A fully responsive website loads faster than an adaptive website and has only one master layout that is styled to fit multiple screens and devices.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Mobile first means designing with the smallest layout first then going up. Mobile first also requires a developer to remember inherited values that should be changed in order to actually change the layout (ie: flex direction's standard is row)

Desktop first means designing from the largest layout all the way to the smallest one.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

It sets the standard font size to 10px.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

It's a way to style with CSS a lot quicker by setting variables for values that developers know they'll be using more often or setting a value with multiple properties that they can type once and re-use. This would then allow a compiler to read that code and change it to CSS.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

I like the idea of mixins and variables. I feel that it allows me to be quicker at development when I can just easily term something. I think the hardest concept for me is parametric mixins right now. It involves a lot more thinking and planning but it does shorten the time to code CSS.
