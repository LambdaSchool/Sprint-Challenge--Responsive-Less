1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
  Adaptive websites have different versions of the site for viewing on different devices. Responsive websites adapt fluidly to a changing viewport.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
  Mobile first means building the CSS with the mobile design as the default and the breakpoints taking effect as the viewport widens. Desktop first is the reverse.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units? 
  It sets a default value for rem units to reference.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
  Making writing CSS easier and more concise and readable with nesting, variables, and powerful tools called mixins that can accept parameters.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 
  I like that it makes CSS feel more like a coding language like javascript. It's a little annoying that autofill doesn't recognize classes and variables from imported files.
