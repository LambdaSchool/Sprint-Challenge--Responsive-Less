1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
   ----> Adaptive website creates a web design or template that are optimum and unique for each device. Responsive website creates a single web design or template for all devices.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
   ----> Mobile first means designing website for mobile device before any other device. Similarly, desktop first means designing website for desktop before any other device.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
   ----> Default font-size of the browser is 16px that is 1rem, and setting font-size: 62.5% converts 16px to 10px which makes 1rem = 10px.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
   ----> Preprocessing is way to write styles in a different language and convert that into CSS.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
   ----> My favorite concept in preprocessing that it follows DRY and also that it makes writing code easy and more organized by nesting and allowing to break up styles into multiple files. The concept that gives me more trouble is mixins, at times they are confusing for me and I hate that it takes more time to figure out writing mixins in a proper and useful way.
