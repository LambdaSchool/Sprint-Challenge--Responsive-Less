1. The difference between Adaptive & Responsive Websites is that with Adaptive you will
   have to design multiple layouts for each device as with Responsive only one is needed with the use of media queries.

2. What it means between Mobile first vs Desktop first is sizing, if you have a website that was made for mobile you only need one, desktops will have to have another site for mobile. Also you won't see the horizontal scroll-bar at the bottom to slide left-right to see content.

3. It allows for easy mathematical calculations since 62.5% allows us to use base 10 when calculating. ex. to find out the font-size for 16px to rem we take 16 divide it by 10 which equals 1.6rem.

4. Preprocessors helps deevelopers write reusable and maintainable code, by writing complex defintions into smaller files and importing them into one main file which will increase productivity and decrease the amount of code you will have to write in a project.

5.My favorite part about preprocessing is the modulization every component's style could be written into it's own file then imported into one main file. What gives me trouble is Parametric Mixins.
