1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Adaptive websites set multiple designs at specific screen sizes to make a website look appealing. On the other hand, responsive websites grow and shrink with the user making the website appealing at any size.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

mobile first uses min-widths to design a responsive website with a mobile device in mind first. The screen then expands to tablet, and desktop views.  Desktop first uses max-widths to design a responsive site with the desktop user in mind first.  Then the screen shrinks to tablet, and mobile.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
sets 10px = 1rem

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
preprocessing allows you to nest css statements within one another as opposed to making them seperate line.  In addition, preprocessors allows you to create variables and mixins that makes applying common elements across multiple lines of CSS simple.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

Mixins are my best friend. You mean to tell me I don't have to keep typing the same styling over and over again? I love it.

As for most trouble,  I didn't really find anything too troubling when dealing with less.  Besides checking the watch list for errors.
