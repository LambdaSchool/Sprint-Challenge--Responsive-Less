What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Adaptive websites will compress the content to easily fit a mobile screen, however they don't allow for different layouts for different screen sizes, nor can they cover a multitude of screen resolutions.

A fully responive website will have its content rearrange and resize depending on the size of the viewport/screen it is being viewed on.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Mobile First:
Start designing the mobile site first with media queries set to min-width.
Desktop First:
Start designing the desktop site first with media queries set to max-width.

It allows you to more efficiently style your documents through nesting, organization, variables, and multi-line styles confined to a single line called mixins.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

Nesting 100%.
