        <p>Adaptive has different site structure, theming, and information depending on the device you are using. Responsive uses media queries to resize and reorder the objects on the site to look best at certain resolutions and sizes.</p>
<p>Mobile first means you primarily focus on making the mobile experience the best then improve it at higher resolutions.
Desktop fist means you go for the best possible desktop experience then make a usable mobile experience even if it&#39;s the the greatest.</p>
<p>It makes pixel size easier to calculate since the pixel size will be 10 times the rem unit.</p>
<p>It adds new features and aims to remove a bit of the cruft from css. It also has the added side benefit of catching syntax errors on compilation.</p>
<p>So far probably the concept of mixins is my favorite. Being able to create a personal mixin library seems pretty great. I also quite like the way media queries are handled.
Probably the most problematic thing for me is just deciding how deep I want to nest things. It&#39;s super tempting to mirror your html but I know that can get quite out of hand.</p>
