1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
Adaptive websites only use breakpoints to change the DOM styling based on the viewport size. Responsive sites do this and
adapt using percentages so that the entire page feels alive.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
Mobile first is building around min-width, desktop first is building around max-width.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?
Makes it so that each rem is = to 10px.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
A hybrid version to write css that increases workflow efficiency and could introduce programming concepts.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
My favorite concept in preprocessing is definitely mixins/variables. I love to avoid repetition and these help alot.
The concept that gives me the most trouble is probably escaping/importing. Sometimes it's hard to imagine the importing
cascade. On both preprocessing I and II I didn't look at the instructions to see how to import, I just played around with it
so that I could learn how important (haha "import" is in that word) importing order is.
