What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

Font size 62.5% makes using rem units easier because  1.6rem is 10px when the font is set to 62.5%. Otherwise with a font set to 100% 10px = 0.625rem which can be confusing when styling.

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessing is a way to incorporate variables, mix-ins and nesting into your CSS. Preprocessing makes writing CSS more efficient. 

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

Mix-ins are my favorite concept because you can define a list of properties and apply it with one line of code. I also found mix-ins to give me the most trouble at first because they were rather confusing, but once you write a few it shortly becomes second nature and I really learned to love them.
