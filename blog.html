    <h2>The Sun Of Nothing</h1>
        <p>A spaceman.
        They say I am a spaceman.
        They say I am
        Planets everywhere... my own destiny...
        I’m floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing.
        Floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing.
        I have become the sun of nothing.
        Nothing is here.
        Memories are not clear.
        I’m floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing.
        Floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing.
        Floating, floating, floating to the sun... farther away.
        I can’t believe that’s what it has come to...
        I never really had it all that bad.
        I just looked around and never thought about the blank stares.
        Blank stares.<br>

    <p>Fly me to the moon
    Let me play among the stars
    Let me see what spring is like on
    A-Jupiter and Mars
    In other words, hold my hand
    In other words, baby, kiss me
    Fill my heart with song and let me sing for ever more
    You are all I long for
    All I worship and adore
    In other words, please be true
    In other words, I love you
    Fill my heart with song
    Let me sing for ever more
    You are all I long for, all I worship and adore
    In other words, please be true
    In other words
    In other words
    I love you
