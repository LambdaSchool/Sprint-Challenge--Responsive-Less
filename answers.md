1. Response web design responds to the size of the screen no matter what size of the screen is. Usually ueses three screens (phones ,tablets and computers)

adptive web design responds to multiple size of the screen of the device

2.The highest specifications , which means as web developer , I should know who is my audince and according to that i set my target .

3. 12px = 0.75rem.
   14px = 0.875rem.
   16px = 1rem (base)
   18px = 1.125rem.

4. rather than write all your code in one css page you can write them in multiple page so you can easily looking for the bugs and also easily fix them .

5) mixins are my favorite, and functions gave some trouble but now i understood them.
